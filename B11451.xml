         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmightie God, moste excellent Princesse, who hath aduaunced you to the gouernment of manie King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, beeing deliuered out of the lyons iavves in your tender yeares: who would that you should not only gouerne so manie and diuers people with your royall scepter, but should also go before them all in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of vnfeigned zeale and syncere affection: vvho defending yovv so often from the secret treacheries of disloyall subiects at home, and from the inuincible <hi>Armada</hi> of a mightie and cruell enimie abroad, the vvinde and seas fighting for you, hath preserued &amp; most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouslie deliuered your royall person and kingdome together with so manie godlie soules, being shrouded vnder the shadovv of your most gratious protection: almightie God, I saie, thus dealing vvith yovv, maie most iustlie accuse vs as most vnthankefull of all men, vnlesse vve shall extoll vvith a solemne thankesgiuing this so great and heauenlie a blessing; and also make knovvne vnto the vvorld both in vvord and vvriting those benefits, which he by your meanes hath bestovved vpon vs. Neither trulie is there anie suspition of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be feared, where a man must needes either speake as the truth is, or else incurre the monstrous vice of ingratitude. And that vvee
<pb facs="tcp:1955:3"/> also, albeit dwelling so farre of in the borders of <hi>Daulphiny,</hi> should account our selves in the number of those, vvho are vnder your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, that your princelie bountie hath caused, vvhereby (renevving that example of the primitiue Church so greatlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apostle) yovv did most liberallie releeue and succour our citie of <hi>Geneua</hi> in those most miserable times of pestilence, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and vvarre, insomuch that vve vvorthely ascribe no small part of our deliuerance to your, and your English subiects true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberalitie. As J vvas thinking of these things, moste noble Queene, according to the charge which in this Church is committed vnto me, partlie the renevved miserie and calamitie of a farre more daungerous vvarre, vvherevvith vve novv at this present are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, called a fresh into my remembrance againe that your excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding benefit, partlie an other occasion opened a most readie vvaie hovv to performe this dutie. For so it fell out, vvhat time that moste sauadge enimie assailed yovv, and the miseries of the French Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches greatlie disquieted vs, and the enimie hard at our gates scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie suffered vs to breath, that euen at the verie same time I expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the historie of <hi>Iob</hi> in this schoole, as an argument most fitt for these vvretched times. For be it that <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> &amp; <hi>David</hi> are for their sound and immoueable faith most vvorthelie commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet notwithstanding the praise of patience doth as it were by a speciall prerogatiue belong vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> as the onelie man vve read of, whom Satā &amp; his ministers with greatest rage assailed, &amp; who more couragiously euen to the end withstood both their assaults &amp; his own infirmities, although not altogither without some token of humane frailtie. For all other christian vertues fight against seuerall vices; but patience, vvhich the Greekes by a more significant vvorde call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both vpholdeth and supporteth them in their conflicts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervvise not like to holde out, and alone in the end obteineth the crowne: vvhich is the cause that that common enimie of mankinde doth vvith greater furie and outrage bend all his force against this vertue, then against all other vertues beside. Novv such things as came into my mind in expounding this part of Scripture, vvhen I had first gathered them into brefe notes and after more diligentlie perusing them, at the request of some of my hearers was intended to publish them, J did thinke for manie and most iust causes that they vvere fit to be dedicated to none rather then to your excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie. For although God hauing compassion on the people vnder your
<pb facs="tcp:1955:3"/> gouernement, hath not permitted Sathan to doe that against yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vvhich he suffered him to doe vnto <hi>Iob:</hi> yet it cannot be doubted bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that, that worker of mischiefe hath for these manie yeares space tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the vvicked practises of your domestical and forreine enimies, vexed and pearced your most godlie soule with infinite and almost incredible cares: yea and it is cleare, that you, beholding all those thinges which befell <hi>Iob,</hi> in manie of those oppressed exiles flying vnto you for refuge, haue in a manner so sensibly felt (such hath your compassion alvvaies bene tovvardes them) all their afflictions, as if they had verie neerelie touched your ovvne person: all vvhich greeuances you, treading in the steppes of this our <hi>Iob,</hi> haue borne out vvith merueilous constancie and patience, neither being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied at the monstrous conspiracies of perfidious traiters, nor terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vvith the threatnings &amp; forcible inuasions of forreine enimies, relying vvhollie vpon Gods prouidence and the testimonie of a good conscience. Hereunto is added, that that notable question of Gods prouidence in ruling of the vvhole vvorld, in which is discussed how that parcialitie, vvhich is commonlie seene in the aduersitie of the godlie and prosperitie of the vvicked, maie be reconciled vvith gods iustice, necessarie to be knovvne of all christians, and especiallie of those, who are aboue others in authoritie, that they maie continue couragious and constant, that question, I saie, vvhereat the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, as it vvere, caried vpon the rockes, haue alreadie made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvracke, the other Philosophers haue violentlie rushed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie also at this daie are grounded; is no vvhere in all my bookes of diuinitie more largely and fullie disputed of, no vvhere handled in a more manifest and certeine application to a particular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, no vvhere determined more plainelie by the vvorde of God: vvhereby I hope it vvill come to passe, that you hauing had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of these things both in your selfe and others, shall hence take no small delight. Moreouer, vvhereas you, most vertuous Queene, being excellentlie vvell seene in all the liberall sciences (an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple most rare in all ages) are accustomed, as I heare, to peruse the bookes of old vvriters both Greeke and Latine, here trulie yovv shal find, or haue already found that which may satisfie your desire. For besides that this vvriter doth most diuinelie, by the direction of Gods spirite, determine of matters, he doth also learnedly graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and eloquentlie discourse of naturall things, and those visible workes of God full of admiration, in which his inuisible power and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:4"/> Godhead are seene, that not any one of those sacred bookes, which are extant, may be iustlie compared to this in the handling of this argument: much lesse doth any prophane Philosopher, vvhen he speaketh most trulie, attaine to the grauitie and heauenlie maiestie of this vvriter. But this booke, then the which there is none in all the Bible, if I be not deceiued, no not <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe, of greater antiquitie, is in manie places made verie obscure to vs and hard to be vnderstood, partly by reason of the profoundnes of the things them selues here debated among most wise men, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of euery one, partlie by diuers straunge vvords &amp; also phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses differing from the pure <hi>Hebrue</hi> (for euen then the puritie not onelie of religion, but also of the <hi>Hebrue</hi> tongue, as the state of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things is alvvaies mutable, began to decaie among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple comming some of the stocke of <hi>Esau,</hi> and some of <hi>Cethura,</hi> &amp; being by little and little scattered here and there throughout the countries neere adioyning) partlie also by certaine vvordes that are not anie vvhere else found, about vvhich the <hi>Hebrevve</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, though othervvise verie skilfull in the tongue, doe greatlie trouble themselues. Wherefore the learned diuines of former ages, both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> in the time of barbarisme deserued great commendation, who studied to inlighten this confused darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And yet trulie vvhosoeuer vvill examine those their expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although godlie and learned by the rule of the true <hi>Hebrevve</hi> context, as in deed he ought, shall find them oftentimes (vvith their good leaue be it spoken) cleane beside the scope of the vvriter. Whereby vve maie see hovv much better it is, from the time of the Apostles and those famous Euangelists, since the gift of tongues and interpretation ceased in the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, for the Church to draw the truth, vvonderfullie deliuered vnto vs from the beginning of the vvorld in the bookes of holie Scripture, and afterward deriued into the riuers as it vvere of the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, by the Apostles how much better, I say, it is, to fetch the truth out of the verie fountaine and thence to conueigh it vnto others, then out of the pooles, that is, out of the <hi>Greeke,</hi> such as it is at this daie, and that common <hi>Latine</hi> translation, both trulie as in the beginning not pure enough, so aftervvard maruelouslie corrupted. And although that learned Father <hi>Ierom</hi> tooke vpon him a labour verie profitable for the Church, in cleansing those corruptions of the <hi>Latine</hi> translations, as farre as his abilitie serued him; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:1955:4"/> much drosse as yet remaineth behind. I omit that custome which hath continued euer since <hi>Origenes</hi> time, I say not of inuerting the naturall sence of the sacred text to the framing of certaine straunge allegories, but euen of marring and peruerting it; (for why should not J speake that vvhich the matter it selfe witnesseth?) In which thing manie excellent men, I knovv not by what fatall iudgement of God, haue passed measure, if there can be anie measure in doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse. Let them therefore consider how well they looke to themselues and prouide for the Church of God, who, albeit the knowledge of tongues and artes be through the great benefite of God restored in this our age, alledging for their excuse the corrupting of the <hi>Hebrue</hi> volumes by the Ievves, and the diuersitie of the <hi>Greeke</hi> copies of the nevv testament, doe streightlie charge &amp; commaund vs against the auncient decrees of their ovvne Popes, to rest in the vulgare <hi>Latine</hi> translation amongst them, and that without all manner of exception: which is all one as if in great plentie of corne they shall bid vs to feede vpon a cornes. Farre be it therefore from all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that be in their right vvits, to obey this so absurd, so vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and so damnable a decree of the Councel, or rather conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> Let them rather enioy so great a benefit, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon them, being most necessarie for the restoring of Christian religion. As for the olde translations, vvhereof <hi>Augustine</hi> hath left in writing long agoe, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> interpreters of holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be numbred, but the <hi>Latine</hi> are without number, I vvish no man should despise them; but I vvould haue all read with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in such sort that those vvhich are able, should haue recourse to the originall, &amp; those which can not, should betake them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, and diligentlie in the feare of God weigh the arguments and reasons of the different interpretation both of the old and new writers. For this can not, neither ought it to be dissembled, that those translations, for the most parte, of the holie Scriptures, are partly through the vnskilfulnes of those mother tongues, and partlie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough negligence of those that copied them out, so corrupted and so manie waies depraued, that as yet none of those diuines, vvhome in this more happie age in this respect, God hath stirred vp to clense his temple, neither profound knowledge, nor intollerable labour and paines, could restore and make perfit.</p>
            <p>With this determination about <hi>40.</hi> yeares since, vvhen I had vvhollie giuen my selfe to the studie of diuinitie, howsoeuer being
<pb facs="tcp:1955:5"/> furnished with the knowledge of the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, I began to compare those so diuers translations of the nevv testament first with the Originall it selfe, and aftervvard vvith the copies of olde and new writers. By this meanes at the last came forth that nevv transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new testament, which vvith the notes added thereunto hath novv fiue times beene corrected and sent abroad vnder your maiesties name and protection: in polishing which worke notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it doth not repent me to trauell as yet dailie more &amp; more. Which thing to attempt likewise in the bookes of the old Testament, I vvas restrained by reason that I could not get anie store of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brevve</hi> copies to my minde. Neuerthelesse I endeauoured to effect somevvhat in tvvo most hard and intricate bookes, to vvit, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes</hi> and the <hi>Psalmes:</hi> the context of vvhich bookes being here and there mended partlie by inserting some few vordes into it, partlie by examining euerie vvord diligentlie by it selfe and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie obseruing the order of the vvhole discourse; I laboured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound by an accurate and plaine paraphrase. All which I did for no other intent, then that I might hereby prouoke and stirre vp the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie of more learned men then my selfe to the performance of that vvhich is better. And novv trulie, behold, I haue aduentured the verie same in this historie of <hi>Iob:</hi> yea, and somwhat more also. For J haue written a full commentarie vpon the two first Chapters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vvherein I haue soundlie and plainlie so farre as I could, vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and laid open manie questions of no small importance, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie that controuersie of the prouidence of God. I haue moreouer set dovvne before the beginnings of all the other Chapters follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both the summe of those things vvhich are handled in them, as also the manner hovv euerie argument therein conteined, is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: the ignorance or rather contempt of such methode, I dare bee bold to saie, hath brought manie both false and also foolish expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not onelie into this booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> but also into the writings of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles.</hi> What I haue performed in these things, J leaue it to the iudgement of other men. I doubt not trulie but that this my indeauour will be of all godlie and indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders allovved and liked of, and the rather if your highnes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your singular bountie, shall vouchsafe to accept of this my slender laboure, as I, vvith all reuerence due to such princelike ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, haue dedicated the same vnto you, not onely in my ovvne name, but in the behalfe also of the vvhole Church and congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:1955:5"/> of <hi>Geneua,</hi> as not vnmindfull of so manie and great benefitts receiued at your Maiesties handes. And thus most renovvmed Queene, I beseech almightie God dailie more and more to blesse you vvith all happinesse and prosperitie, vsing againe those gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie verses, vvhich I suppose are alreadie come to your hands.</p>

I am therefore minded to expound the historie of <hi>Job,</hi> in which, as in other bookes of the holie Scripture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>re of necessitie sometime sayle, as it were, amongst the rocks: and yet I hope I shal not make any shipwracke, trusting first in Gods gracious assistance, and then in your prayers, and moreover vsing the helpe of the most learned, both old and especiallie new writers, who haue beaten the way before me. Amongst whome I may reckon in the chiefest place those three Divines of most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memorie, whom God hath raised vp in these latter daies, I meane <hi>John Oecolampadius, John Calvin,</hi> and lastlie <hi>John Mercer,</hi> whose learned Commentaries I haue caused to be published and set foorth in this Church, from whence I would wish you to take whatsoeuer belongeth to the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall sence and construction of the Hebrue text, But this
<pb facs="tcp:1955:7"/> Latine interpretation which he hath intermingled in that worke of his, I my selfe am purposed to follow &amp; lay open, as being the best and most faithfullie handled. Yet in the meane time, I shall not hide, if, for the small iudgement which I haue, I shall thinke any thing may well be amended herein.</p>
            <p>Nowe this booke among the <hi>Hebrues</hi> simply beareth the name and title of <hi>Job:</hi> concerning whome many doubts are commonly made, and those not impertinent or vnnecessary. And first of all it may be demaunded, whether there were ever any such <hi>Job</hi> indeede, as here is spoken of. For there are some of opinion that this whole argument and treatise is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither imaginarie, devised onely for the vse and instruction of the Church. But this is in no wise to be graunted &amp; yeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto, both because it greatlie derogateth from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and worthines of this booke, and also for that in the 14. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> vers. 14. &amp; 20. the Lord speaketh of <hi>Iob,</hi> as of a moste holie man, and reckoneth him vp togither with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> Likewise <hi>James,</hi> vndoubtedlie alleadging no fable or feygned person in the 5. Chapter and 11. verse, willeth vs to looke vnto him: also <hi>Chrysostome</hi> witnesseth that his sepulcher hath beene shewed in <hi>Arabia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next doubt is, who this <hi>Job</hi> was and of what stocke or kindred he came. For true it is that here he is said to be of the land of <hi>Huz:</hi> But by this name we finde that more then one among the Fathers were called. One we read of in the tenth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse 23. who was the third from <hi>Noah,</hi> and the sonne of <hi>Aram:</hi> of another in the 22. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse 21. the sonne of <hi>Nachor Abrahams</hi> brother by <hi>Milcha:</hi> a third wee read of in the 36. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse 28. who is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the posteritie of <hi>Esau,</hi> to whome I referre this <hi>Job,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie seeing that the lande of <hi>Huz</hi> in the 4. of <hi>Ieremies</hi> Lamentations, verse 21. is placed in <hi>Jdumea,</hi> next to <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> from whence it is said, that the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> came violentlie vpon <hi>Jobes</hi> servants, and tooke away his oxen. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take this <hi>Job</hi> for an <hi>Idumean,</hi> as also his friends were partlie <hi>Jdumeans,</hi> partly nere borderers to them.</p>
            <p>And here againe how many descents and generations <hi>Job</hi> was from <hi>Esau,</hi> it is not certen. But to let passe their dreames and vaine coniectures, who suppose him to haue beene of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:7"/> later times, their opinion seemeth to me to be most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and most agreeable to the course of the holie historie, who thinke that <hi>Iob</hi> liued, and that all these things happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the time that the Israelites were freed from the bondage of Aegipt. Last of all it is a question, by whome this booke was written, but hereof <hi>Gregorie</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> iudgeth very well and wisely, that it is to no purpose to search and enquire who is the writer of that booke, of which we acknowledge the holy Ghost to be author. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herewith content our selues, that we know this booke to haue beene receiued for holy and Canonicall by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent of the Church from time to time, and also that <hi>James</hi> the Apostle hath by manifest authoritie confirmed the same. Now the matter it selfe giueth sufficient euidence, that these speaches were not taken and written from the mouthes of those who are here brought in talking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring togither; but it is more likelie that they were penned either by <hi>Job</hi> him selfe, beeing a very wise and eloquent man, or by his friends, who happilie laying their heads togither, by the direction of the holie Ghost wrote this historie, whether in prose, or (as <hi>Jerome</hi> thinketh) in Hexamiter verses, from the 3. Chapter to the 5. verse of the last Chapter: but in what measure and number he telleth not, neither can it easilie be shewed. Moreover I cannot vtterly reiect that which some men set downe for a truth, that this booke was written by <hi>Moses,</hi> while he aboad as a straunger among the <hi>Madianites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer this whole discourse standeth of enterchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable speaches to and fro, the beginning and ende of the booke onely excepted: and if it were not that it is shut vp with a ioyfull and wished ende, it might rightly both for the matter, (then which nothing can be thought or imagined more graue and weightie) and also for the exceeding wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of the persons, that here talke and reason together, be called a Tragedie; not as a feigned or deuised poeme, but as a thing done indeede, and afterward most faithfully, most grauely, and in a worde, most divinely written: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with euen in the iudgement of man, no writing of any Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, either in respect of matter or words, may rightly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:1955:8"/>
            <p>The Actors or speakers herein, are God him selfe, <hi>Satan, Iob, Iobs</hi> wife and his fower friends: to wit, <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad, Tsophar,</hi> and <hi>Ely:</hi> whose conference, as also this whole booke may, in my iudgement, not vnfitly be deuided into these partes.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of the booke to the ende of the 9. verse of the seconde Chapter is conteined as it were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Proeme, in which are inserted two dialogues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> whereupon ariseth the occasion of this Tragedie: which may stande for the first <hi>Scene</hi> of the first <hi>Acte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the tenth verse of the said Chapter, beginneth the second <hi>Scene</hi> of the first <hi>Acte,</hi> which is a Dialogue betweene <hi>Iob</hi> and his wife. The remnant of that Chapter is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme and entrance into the second <hi>Acte:</hi> then immediatly followeth the first <hi>Scene</hi> of the second <hi>Acte,</hi> and the busiest part of the Tragedie in the whole third Chapter, where <hi>Iob</hi> alone grieuously complaineth of his miserie.</p>
            <p>Hence springeth that conference &amp; disputation betwene <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends; the first speakers are <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> from the beginning of the fourth Chapter to the end of the seuenth, which is the second <hi>Scene</hi> of the second <hi>Acte.</hi> From the eight Chapter to the ende of the tenth, the speakers are <hi>Bildad</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> which make the third <hi>Scene</hi> of the seconde <hi>Acte.</hi> In the eleventh Chapter and so forwarde to the ende of the fourteenth, the speakers are <hi>Tsophar</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and this is the fourth <hi>Scene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this followeth the thirde <hi>Acte;</hi> in the first <hi>Scene</hi> whereof, <hi>Elephas</hi> debateth the matter with <hi>Iob:</hi> and it endeth in the last verse of the 17. Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the second <hi>Scene, Bildad</hi> reasoneth against <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters 18. and 19,</p>
            <p>In the thirde, <hi>Tsophar</hi> speaketh and <hi>Job</hi> maketh answere, Chap. 20. &amp; 21.</p>
            <p>In the fourth, <hi>Elephaz</hi> nowe againe the third time encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with <hi>Iob,</hi> from the 22. Chap. to the ende of the 24.</p>
            <p>In the fifth, <hi>Bildad</hi> setteth a fresh vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> Chapter 25. and <hi>Job</hi> replieth in the Chapters 26.27.28.29.30.31.</p>
            <p>In the fourth <hi>Acte Elihu</hi> is brought in, who sharply reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:1955:8"/> both <hi>Iob</hi> and his friendes, from the 32. Chapter to the ende of the 37.</p>
            <p>The fift <hi>Acte</hi> is as it were the conclusion of all the rest: in which God him selfe breaketh off the whole disputation, so blaming <hi>Iob,</hi> that neuerthelesse he giueth iudgement on his side. As for his friendes, he rebuketh them very sharpely, for taking vpon them the defence of an euill cause: and all this is done from the 38. Chapter to the 9. verse of the 42. Chap.</p>
            <p>In the verses following to the ende of the booke, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined a short narration of the ioyfull issue of all these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; which is as it were the Epilogue or shutting vp of the whole Tragedie.</p>
            <p>But that which principally is here to be sought for, is this, namely, what is the scope and drift of this treatise. Some are of opinion that the chiefe end hereof is to proove and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gods prouidence: neither doe I denie but that this matter is here very plentifully &amp; excellently handled of most wise men, and determined by Gods owne voyce. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the argument of Gods prouidence is more large, and extendeth it selfe farther, I rather allowe their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who thinke that the iustice of God and mans righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse are the chiefe things debated and reasoned vpon in this booke; and that not in generall, but in some certaine respect and particular consideration. And first as touching God; whether it may stand with his iustice, that those men, who are of an honest and vpright conversation, should suffer so great affliction, or, to speake in fewe wordes, whether it be not against Gods iustice, that in this life it should goe well with the wicked and ill with the godly: on the other side, touching men, the question is made, whether we may iudge them the better or more righteous because of their prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wherein they liue, or the worse and more wicked for the adversitie which they suffer. Both which questions, although in the processe of this disputation they are indefinitely and in generall discoursed vpon; notwithstanding they are here for the most part brought to a particularitie, and restrained to the person of <hi>Iob,</hi> and his present estate. For <hi>Iobs</hi> friendes could not discerne howe this extreme and vnlooked for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, whereinto <hi>Iob</hi> was fallen, might agree with Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:9"/> and that holinesse of life and innocencie, that seemed to be in <hi>Iob:</hi> and therefore they exhort him to acknowledge his hypocrisie, and to craue mercie at the hands of God. On the otherside <hi>Iob</hi> (his conscience bearing him witnesse of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie and vprightnes of his heart, is not resolued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the first point, namely, howe it might come to passe that he being indeede a sinner (for that he denyeth not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he was borne in sinne) but who neuerthelesse had from his heart, to the best of his power, behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe rightly both toward God and men; should so on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den be cast downe, and be ouercharged with so sore a tempest of aduersitie. For the second part of their accusation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in that he is so grievously afflicted, they hereupon goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to inferre that he is an hypocrite and a most wicked person; he most earnestly standeth against them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his innocencie, and complaineth of the great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie they doe him, who pretending that they came to comfort him, added one affliction to another, as though it were not more then ynough which he alreadie suffered. Here then we may see that <hi>Iobs</hi> friendes were in a double errour, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued both in the generall grounde, and in the particular conclusion. First, they erred in the generall ground, thinking it not agreeable to Gods iustice in such manner to lay his heauie hand vpon the godly, and suddenly to bring vpon them so grievous tribulation: or, which is all one, that such troubles befall men for their sinnes, &amp; so consequently that none can indeede be a good man, who suddenly is ouertaken with affliction. They erred also in the particular conclusion, because they vntruely applyed both the one and the other to the person of <hi>Iob:</hi> and yet in the meane time they reason many things very excellently and truely concerning Gods providence and iustice, though the conclusion be false, which they would gather and inferre thereupon. Nowe <hi>Iob,</hi> albeit concerning this matter he thinke and iudge more rightly then they: neverthelesse being ouercharged both with the greatnesse of his griefe and the despitefull dealing of his friendes, he is nowe and then carryed too farre in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooving his owne innocencie both in the sight of God, as also vnto his friendes: and being moreouer partly through
<pb facs="tcp:1955:9"/> the arguments alleadged by his friendes, fallen into the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searcheable deapth of Gods iudgements, he cannot so well acquite him selfe, but that he must needes in some sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray mans frailtie and corruption. And yet (the hande of God still vpholding him) he neuer breaketh out into any blasphemous thoughtes or speaches; but contrariwise, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a stout champion of God, he getteth the vpper hand and victoriously triumpheth ouer Satan.</p>
            <p>Nowe this question is very weightie and of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, long agoe handled and debated euen in the very first ages, as here it most evidently appeareth: and albeit this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie hath bene throughly discussed and decided by the mouth of God him selfe: yet this could not so much prevaile, but that <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 73. and <hi>Ieremie</hi> in the 15. chapter of his Prophesie, and <hi>Habacuk</hi> in his first chapter, being very much troubled about this point, seemed to make a new doubt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Neither had the auncient <hi>Epicures</hi> in time past any more principall foundation to leane vnto: and the wicked euen at this day doe hereupon build their manifest atheisme and impietie. Verily al this doubt proceeded from that infectious poyson of Satan, which he hid vnder the glorious name of the knowledge of good and euill, at such time as he beguiled our first parents. For whence is it that such pestilent cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons creepe into our minds, but that, beeing as it were vtterlie void of reason, wee thinke that onely to be right and good, the cause and reason whereof we our selues doe conceiue &amp; like of, and goe about to square the infinite wisdome and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God to the most crooked rule of our owne weake and slender capacitie? Such also at this day are the clamours of them, who crie out that we make God the authour of sinne, when we say that nothing is done rashly, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his will and foreknowledge, but that whatsoeuer is thought, spoken or done, commeth to passe, God having wisely and iustly decreed the same, whether he doe vse good or euill instruments. In like manner their blasphemies, who take away Gods eternall decree of reprobation, who accuse vs for bringing in a Stoicall necessitie: finally who will not heare the Apostle beating downe these Gyants, as it were with this thunderbolt, <hi>O man who art thou that pleadest against
<pb facs="tcp:1955:10"/> God?</hi> Rom. 9. verse 20. Hereby may be gathered, howe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine is cōteined in this book, in the discussing of so graue and weightie an argument; that we neither followe the example of Iobs three friendes, measuring Gods wisdom and righteousnesse by our owne simple vnderstanding, nor yet plunge our selues into the bottomlesse deapth of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible wisedome: but (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh after he had bene reprooued by God) that we lay our hands vpon our mouthes &amp; learne, that the secrets of God are rather highly to be reuerenced, then deepely and curiously to be searched into. Concerning which matter <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking at large in his booke of the Preacher, teacheth vs not to seeke to be ouer wise: with whome also the Apostle agreeth, willing vs not to be wise aboue that which is meete.</p>
            <p>Many other thinges are in this most learned and godly booke set before vs worthie to be obserued, as namely in <hi>Iob,</hi> we haue an example of a good master of a familie, and howe they ought to behaue them selues, who for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and riches, beare a greater sway in the common wealth; that they may not onely haue the bare name of Citizens, but also be accounted Fathers of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
            <p>Herein moreover, that most certen and auncient Science of Natural causes is discouered and taught, togither with the true end and vse thereof: which beeing here more largelie entreated of, <hi>Paul</hi> in few, but yet most heavenlie words one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointeth at. Rom. 1. vers. 19. and in his disputation at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi> Act. 17.26. Which doctrine, is so much the more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, because from the ignorance and wicked abuse thereof, hath sprong all idolatrie and superstition. The wise men of other nations, whome the <hi>Greekes</hi> call Philosophers, haue, touching the true vse, merveilouslie prophaned it: of some of them it hath beene very basely and slenderlie handled: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue corrupted it with manifest impieties; that I speak nothing of those errours, which the old Philosophers haue brought in, and which haue beene shewed and confuted by <hi>Aristotle;</hi> who himselfe also is misliked of some as a misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter and false accuser of other mens sayings, whereas he himselfe hath diuers waies swarued from the trueth; and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:10"/> it is sure that no man in many things can cleare and acquite him of impietie. What of this moreouer, that the abuse of this Science hath bred that detestable Art <hi>Magick,</hi> which is the welspring of al mischiefe; as also that false divining <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,</hi> which hauing broken the bounds of true Natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, entreth into the very secrets of God, and at this day hath bewitched the whole world? Lastly, for true Christian <hi>Ethicks</hi> &amp; all manner of duties which are to be performed to our neighbour either at home or a broad, we haue here, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially among rich men, in <hi>Iobs</hi> person a most rare example. set before our eyes as it were in a table to behold: by so much more excellent then all the precepts of the <hi>Platonists</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> by how much deeds are better then words, and action is to be preferred before vaine and idle speculation. But among the rest of <hi>Iobs</hi> vertues, the invincible constancie of his godly minde, most wonderfullie sheweth it selfe; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning both that iron disposition and vnsensiblenes of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and also whatsoeuer the Philosophers babble of their vaineglorious fortitude and Magnanimitie: insomuch that not without good cause <hi>Iames</hi> biddeth vs looke vnto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of patience, as well in the conflict and triall it selfe, as in the happie and ioyfull end of the same. For surelie wee doe not reade of any (except the onely Sonne of God, in whome all things were perfit in the highest degree) who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was more grieuouslie vexed and afflicted, or who did with greater courage and constancie wrestle with and passe through those miseries, as did this our Champion: so that in this conflict he may truly be said to haue caried away the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the victorie. Neuerthelesse it can not be denyed, but that his patience was ioyned with humane frailtie, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was such, as God, making an end of all these troubles, doth find therein great wants and imperfections. But hereby we must rather learne that euen those, who runne best in the course of this life and of their vocation; are notwithstanding very farre from the highest point of perfection. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although the crowne of everlasting happines be not giuen but to those who rightlie striue for it and continue in the race without fainting or giuing ouer vnto the end of their life: yet that no man receiueth it as a reward due vnto his
<pb facs="tcp:1955:11"/> merits (for Christ alone, and no other, hath by his most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite obedience obteyned it for vs) but that our race is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and crowned of Gods most free mercie and louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Seeing now all this is as I haue said, and seeing wee are fallen into those times, in which the Lord both to punish the desperate contempt of his Gospell, and also to sift, exercise, and trie his children, hath, if euer at any time, now let loose the raynes to the devill and his angells; I haue not without great cause among the other parts of holie Scripture, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and taken in hand to interpret this booke. In which busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes I beseech almightie God that his spirite, which he hath promised vs, and which he hath neuer denyed to those, who are rightlie gathered togither in his name, may be present both with me speaking, and with you hearing; that the mist of our ignorance beeing taken away, and our minds clensed from the corruption of sinne, neither I nor you may repent vs of our laboure.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was a man.]</hi> This chapter I may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuide into three parts: the first, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in the first fiue verses, declareth who this <hi>Iob</hi> was, and of what account &amp; estimation both with God and men: also what benefits he had receiued at the hands of God, as who is pleased with righteousnes. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.16. And yet if we will iudge aright, all this was of Gods free grace, that <hi>Iob</hi> was such a one towards God and men, as here he is described. <hi>For who hath giuen to him first?</hi> The second part conteyneth the decree of God concerning <hi>Iobs</hi> triall and temptation, whome Satan laboureth to ouerthrow. The third part from the twentith verse to the end of the chapter, setteth forth <hi>Iobs</hi> victorie in this first conflict. Now whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in this place is spoken of <hi>Iob,</hi> it serueth not onely to set before our eyes a most singular example of a man trulie bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed here vpon earth: but also maketh very much to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying of that heauie and tragicall discourse that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. For this had beene no straunge matter, that a man abusing the great blessing of God, should suddenlie fall as it were from the top of prosperitie, into extreame miserie, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the punishment due to ingratitude and vnthankefulnes: seeing histories both sacred and prophane yeald vs many such examples, and these times offer vs not a few. But that so godlie and so a iust man, liuing in great prosperitie, should on a suddeine become so wretched and vnhappie, it might seeme a thing altogither incredible. Moreouer all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs <hi>Jobs</hi> constancie, which is so much the more wonderfull, by how much this chaunge was more suddeine and vnlooked for. For a man that hath beene exalted from a
<pb facs="tcp:1955:12"/> base and poore estate to riches and honour, afterward to fall againe into his former condition, which he had before knowne &amp; tasted, it were a thing more common &amp; lesse gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a great deale. But for him who hath continually enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so great blessings both of bodie and minde, and who hath beene highly esteemed both for his great vertues and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wealth, at a sudden, when he feareth and doubteth least, to be cast downe, and, as if God and men, heauen and earth were set against him, to be made a mirrour of misfortune; of so rich a man to become so poore, of a father of so many children by a mischaunce so strange to be bereft of al, finallie at one instant to be wounded with so many greevances, such as it is not possible for a man to susteine greater; &amp; yet for all this not to faint, but rather hereby to gather courage, &amp; to be pricked forward vnto vertue and godlines, this, out of question, is a most rare example of a most singular and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie magnanimitie. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> is here called a <hi>Man</hi> by a figure of excellencie, that is, a notable man, a man great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie renowmed among those people. For such is the force and meaning of the Hebrue word which is here vsed, that it doth not onely note the sexe, but signifieth a man of great worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excellencie, as also the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth sometimes among the Greekes, and <hi>Vir</hi> among the Latines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the land of Huz.]</hi> That is, in <hi>Idumaea,</hi> as I haue before shewed in the Preface. And this declareth not onely of what cuntrie he was, but also that he came of the race and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage of <hi>Edom,</hi> or <hi>Esau:</hi> which thing maketh very much to this present purpose. For who will not merueile, that there should be a man of such rare vertue, wisdome, and godlines, beeing, I graunt, borne of the stocke of Abraham and Isaac, but yet no Israelite, nor brought vp in Iacobs house. For this maketh more to his commendation, that he liued so religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie among the contemners of God, such as the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> for the most part were, and that he was so good a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who were most wicked; then if he should haue liued vertuouslie among vertuous men, and religiouslie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such as feared God. There are here beside certaine things not vnworthie the noting: and first of all that God at such time as he made his couenant with Abrahā &amp; with his
<pb facs="tcp:1955:12"/> seede after him, seemeth not foorthwith to reiect all other nations and kindreds of the earth. For it is manifest by that which we read in the stories of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that the true knowledge of God which had beene receiued from the Patriarkes, was not yet altogither forgotten, no not among the posteritie of <hi>Cham,</hi> from whome both the Aegyptians and the Chananites had their beginning. And how could it be I pray you, that the Church should be shut vp within the walles of Abrahams house, seeing <hi>Melchisedech</hi> beeing a type of Christ himselfe, was at the same time a priest of the most high God? who if he were that <hi>Sem,</hi> as some haue not without reason conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, we shall finde that he liued 34. yeeres after <hi>Abraham,</hi> when Esau and Iacob were about the age of 49. yeeres. Therfore euen then there was a Church, ouer &amp; besides that which was in the house of Abraham; in which also might be found the true markes of the Church, namely, the promise of the blessed seede to come, and sacrifices which were in deede nothing else but Sacraments. Yet it is true that these in other places began to grow out of vse, and to be abused, with Abraham they remained more pure, who also had this honour aboue others, that the sacrament of Circumcision properlie belonged to him, and to his house, into which the whole Church was by little and little gathered; insomuch that whosoeuer was not circumcised, was esteemed as no member of the Church. Now then the time of the reiection of the Gentiles, as me thinketh, may fitlie be referred to the comming of the people out of Aegypt, and the renewing of the couenant of Circumcision: Exod. 12.48. Levit. 12.3. Whereunto Paul seemeth to haue relation in that excellent sermon of his, which he made at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia.</hi> Act. 13.17.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be noted, ariseth hereof, that God is said to haue hated <hi>Esau;</hi> and <hi>Malachie</hi> witnesseth that God had alotted him his dwelling place in the mountaine of <hi>Seir,</hi> without the land of <hi>Chanaan,</hi> in signe, as it should seeme, that he was excluded out of the couenant; the same curse lying also vpon his posteritie, as which hath beene a continuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of Gods people, and would not suffer them returning
<pb facs="tcp:1955:13"/> out of the captiuitie of Aegypt, to passe through their cuntry. Which if it be so, how is <hi>Iob</hi> here accounted so godly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious a man, euen by the testimonie of Gods owne mouth? I answere, that albeit <hi>Esau</hi> in deede shewed himselfe diuers wayes to be a prophane and an vngodlie wretch; albeit also Gods fearefull iudgement lay vpon him, and extended it selfe to his children after him: yet he is onely said to haue lost his birthright, and not to be vtterlie shut out from the couenant of promise. And whereas he went apart out of the lande of Chanaan, I denie not, but that it came to passe by the secret providence of God, foreshewing that which afterward came to passe by his iust iudgement; but it may not so be taken as if God had at that time simply excluded the <hi>Idumeans</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any way partakers of his couenant, from which the very Gentiles were not immediately debarred, as I before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Therefore euen then also the true knowledge and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God remayned among the posteritie of <hi>Esau,</hi> if not in euery one, yet vndoubtedlie in those whome God had blessed: which worship of God they receiued not onely from the auncient Patriarkes, but more speciallie from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and reuelations shewed to Abraham and Isaac. For it is not to be doubted, but that Abraham (as God himselfe witnesseth of him) herein diligentlie and carefullie instructed his nephewes <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> who, as appeareth by the due computation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> yeeres, were 15. yeeres old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abraham dyed. Gen. 18.19. But what neede I say more? The tree is knowne by his fruit. How great knowledge of heauenlie doctrine there was not onely in <hi>Iob,</hi> but also in his friends, with what reuerence and zeale they were mooued, euen where they are deceiued: and lastlie how wonderfullie they excelled in wisdome and loue of true religion, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, partlie by their mutuall conferences one with another, &amp; partly by the manner of Gods communication with them. And seeing also that they togither with their whole families, as it is most likelie, were not without the seale of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I meane Circumcision, I can not doubt but that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Gods hatred towards <hi>Esau</hi> and his seede: the same beeing vniuersallie considered, and not seuerallie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie particular person) <hi>Iob</hi> and all the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> such as him
<pb facs="tcp:1955:13"/> selfe was, though they were not Israelites by birth, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse the true members of the Church. And to applie this to our owne times (in which wee see that is come to passe in the east and west parts, which Paul and Iohn foretold concerning the generall Apostacie and falling away from the faith, God by this meanes punishing the contempt of the word in those former ages) although Antichrist that man of perdition hath by little and little crept in, and now sitteth in the temple of God, whose kingdome is quite contrarie to the kingdome of Christ, and therefore whosoeuer cleaue to him, can not be of Christs flocke, yet forasmuch as there are in spite of Satan and Antichrist, still remaining the tokens and pledges of the Church, it is not to be doubted but that God hath alwaies had, and at this present hath his chosen and elect euen amongest that Antichristian broode, as he had Daniel and diuers other holie men in the middest of the <hi>Babilonian</hi> captiuitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we doe here obserue what the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church is for the most part hereupon earth. For loe, while the <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> prophane men, no doubt, a number of them, and vnlike to <hi>Iob,</hi> with many other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the east, which were the ofspring of <hi>Abraham</hi> by his concubines, liued quietlie at home, and flourished in all kinde of wealth and iolitie, the Israelites on the otherside were held in grieuous seruitude vnder the tyrannie of the Aegyptians. Gen. 25.6. But marke the issue of the prosperity of the one, and the others aduersitie. Their fall was most wretched and lamentable, as who shortly after were quite cut off from the couenant of life, and contrariwise these were made partakers of great happines, in that all other nations beeing reiected, God chose them to be a proper &amp; peculiar people vnto himselfe. Let vs not therefore esteeme of the Church by multitude or outward felicitie: but let vs preferre the crosse for vertue and righteousnes before all the flitting and momentary ioyes of the wicked. But this we must take by the way, that god made choise of the Israelites, &amp; brought them into the land of Chanaan, of his free mercy &amp; good wil, and not for any worthinesse in them more then in any other nations (as Moses putteth them in minde in
<pb facs="tcp:1955:14"/> that song of his. Deut. 32. vers. 8, 9, &amp;c. and after Moses, Iosua in his exhortation which he made to the people before his death. Ios. 24.) that he that gloryeth might glorie in the Lord. 1. Cor. vers. 31.</p>
               <p>Now of this thing I can not but merueile, whence these mē should haue so great knowledge of the secrets of nature. For albeit the <hi>Science</hi> of things naturall be not heere purposelie deliuered and taught: yet it is sure that vnlesse they had bin herein very wel and throughlie instructed, they could neuer so trulie, so deuoutlie and grauelie haue reasoned of these matters. It is therefore most true that <hi>Adam</hi> had naturallie engrafted in him from his creation the perfit knowledge of all good and profitable learning, vvithout vvhich he could not haue liued vvell, nor haue rightlie gouerned all other creatures, nor haue vsed that dominion and authoritie, vvhich God had giuen him, to the true end, namely to the glorie of God his Creator. This vvisdome though it be very much defaced by mans fall: yet God hath preserued in our minds certeine seedes of knovvledge and good arts, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vvhich, of men vve should become beasts. Hence it is that the principles and generall notions of all Artes are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie imprinted in euery mans vnderstanding, vvhich made <hi>Plato</hi> thinke that vvhen men by teaching begin to knovv that vvhereof before they seemed ignorant, they doe not so much learne any nevv thing, as remember that vvhich they had forgotten. I am therefore of opinion, that the most auncient Patriarkes, as they learned the creation of the world of our first parents, so also that they were most skilful in the true Naturall philosophie, in vvhich the whole vvorld vvith all the parts thereof both simple and compound, supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and inferiour, are searched and laid open: and this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knovvledge, as also more principallie the doctrine of true godlines, chieflie remained in the house and posteritie of Abraham. <hi>A</hi> manifest proofe hereof is that excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the creation of the vvorld made by <hi>Moses,</hi> if the same be compared vvith <hi>Platos Timoeus,</hi> and especiallie vvith <hi>Aristotles</hi> fond dreame of the vvorlds eternitie, though the matter should be iudged by humane reasons and arguments. This is further confirmed to vs not onely by this booke,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:14"/> which either is of greater antiquitie then <hi>Moses,</hi> or, as others thinke, written by <hi>Moses</hi> him selfe; but also by diuers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Psalmes, in which these things are in such manner set forth, that they cannot possibly either more truely &amp; graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or more eloquentlie and learnedlie be deliuered. What shall I say of <hi>Solomon?</hi> whose bookes if they were all extant, doubtles whatsoeuer the wise men of other nations haue left in writing concerning these matters, in comparison of them, would be esteemed as little worth. Hence it is, that in diuers cuntries many haue beene famous, as the first inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and finders out of Arts, and other profitable things, and haue for the same cause beene esteemed as Gods after their death; whereas notwithstanding it is cleare out of the sacred histories, that the most auncient vse of such things hath bin amongst the people of God. As for the vse of letters, we may plainly see by the alphabets of all nations that it was first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> Neither yet doth that seeme vntrue which <hi>Josephus</hi> in his first booke of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> Chap. 1.8. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth concerning the Aegyptians, taught and instructed by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that (the light of nature togither with the knowledge of the true God and his holie worship by little and little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people of the earth in one place through Satans illusions degenerating into <hi>Magick</hi> and horrible idolatrie, in other partlie defiled with infinite lyes, and partlie of set purpose obscured, or rather prophaned with mystical fables and riddles: finallie in other places beginning to decay and likelie in short space euery where to perish and to be vtterlie extinguished) men would haue growen to be most beastlie and sauadge, had not God raised vp excellent wits, for the restoring of Artes and liberall knowledge. The Greekes are thought to haue taken the knowledge of Philosophie from the Aegyptians, but yet a long time after when now it was very much corrupted. Yea, <hi>Solon</hi> one of the seauen wise men, and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and afterward <hi>Plato</hi> are said there to haue beene taught and instructed. But with how great a mist of ignorance all Philosophie among the Greekes hath bin darkened, it may appeare by their manifold sects, and endles contentions; so that some of the chiefest of them haue not beene ashamed to say, that there is no certen knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:1955:15"/> to be had of any thing, and they haue also gone about to prooue by argument this their bold and intollerable asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thereby sufficiently refuting them selues. Let this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stand for an vndoubted truth (both against prophane men, who examine whatsoeuer they finde in the Scriptures concerning these matters by their false grounds &amp; deceaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Axioms,</hi> &amp; also against those smatterers, who in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect make no account at al of these heauenlie writings) that as al true religion is to be fetched onely out of Gods word, so also that the whole knowledge of naturall things, which wee finde in prophane Philosopers, (I except not <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in my iudgement the chiefe of all the rest) ought to be tried and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled by the rule of the Scriptures, vnlesse we will wilfullie depart and wander from the truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpright.]</hi> I had rather so translate it, then <hi>Perfit,</hi> least any man happilie might be deceiued in the signification of the word. For whatsoeuer is spoken of the vertues of <hi>Job,</hi> or any other man (except Christ alone, who was free from the least blemish of vice) cannot be vnderstood without some manner of defect and imperfection, by reason of the continuall fight which is betweene the flesh and the Spirite. We neede not seeke any further proofe hereof. <hi>Jobs</hi> example may suffice, who although he were the most constant and most patient of all men that euer were, yet was he not altogither blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, as appeareth in that God reprooueth him afterward in the Chap. 38. vers. 2. In the Greeke translation there is some diuersitie. Some read it <gap reason="foreign">

Of these three which are read in the Greeke context, two must needes be superfluous, and it is not vnlikelie that they haue beene brought in by reason of diuers interpretations, through their negligence who wrote out the Greeke coppies, which is a common fault in those bookes. Now by the name of <hi>Vprightnesse</hi> or <hi>simplicitie,</hi> (as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> is said to be an vpright man, and Christ willeth vs to be simple as doues) is vnderstood a minde void of all manner of fraud and dissimulation. VVhich commendation, Satan in the 9. verse of this chapter, and <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in the chapters following, labour to take from him, but in vaine and without
<pb facs="tcp:1955:15"/> cause as the end prooued. The seat of this vertue is in the will or affection, and it is in a manner the forme and life of all other vertues, by which they are discerned to be true or counterfeit; and as God is the searcher of the heart, so this vertue hath God properlie for a iudge and a witnesse vnto it. And surelie if I may so speake, we doe not in any thing so nerely resemble God, as in this, who because he is truth it selfe, therefore loueth truth and abhorreth falshood and lies, whereof Satan is the author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And iust.]</hi> Hereby is meant, that he shewed and made proofe of that simplicitie and vprightnesse of his heart, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his iust and honest dealing, as <hi>Job</hi> by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his friends accusations is driuen afterwards to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of him selfe in the 29. &amp; 31. Chapters. For that which <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of faith, that that onely is a true and liuelie faith which sheweth it selfe by good workes, must also be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to al other vertues. Wherfore <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his first booke of <hi>Ethicks</hi> did herein very well (although otherwise he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew the chiefe vettues nor the true cause and the true effects of the rest) that he imagined the chiefe good not to consist in bare vertue by it selfe, but rather in the operation and action of vertue. But peraduenture you will say, if he be an vpright man who walketh in the right way, and the right way be the Law of the Lord, which was not yet giuen when these things happened vnto <hi>Job,</hi> how is it that he is called an vpright man? Hereunto the Apostle maketh answere in the second to the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the fourtenth verse, that to the Gentiles their conscience was a Law accusing or excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the deedes of euery one of them. And surelie so it is. For whereas God in the <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> deliuered to his people the ten Commaundements conteined in two tables, we are not thereof to gather, that then and not before, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed what duties men were to performe to God and their neighbours, but rather, that he then renued that immutable law of Nature, which was from the beginning written in the harts of all men, and from whence all good lawes haue bin deriued; partlie to the ende the Israelites might be shut out from all excuse, as who had beene twise taught, that is, first of Nature, as all other nations, and then more speciallie of God
<pb facs="tcp:1955:16"/> him selfe; and partly because at the same time the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of God, intreated of in the first table, was turned into i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie and worshipping of many Gods: yea the duties of honest behauiour and iustice to be obserued, kept, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined betweene man and man, which belong to the second table, began to be forgotten and to be quite peruerted; as may appeare by the lawes and customes of diuers cuntries. For with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> it was accounted no dishonestie to steale; with the Aegyptians it was lawfull for the brother to ioyne in mariage with his owne sister: that I say nothing of the incestuous pollutions of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> whereof the Lord him selfe witnesseth vnto his seruant Moses. Hereunto may be added the hauing of mo wiues at once, as also diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; both which God did beare in the Iewes almost (that I may so speake) against his will, for the hardnesse of their harts. <hi>Job</hi> therefore walked not in this sort, but, no doubt, he was in that cuntrie a most notable and singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all true godlines and vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One that feared God.]</hi> No man can be ignorant that by the feare of God in this place is not meant any dread or terrour proceeding from an euill conscience, whereby men rather feare the punishment of sinne, then sinne it selfe: but a holie reuerence of the infinite maiestie of God proceeding from the loue of him, to whome we acknowledge all obedience to be due; and therefore from this feare springeth all true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Here then we must note a difference betweene those which they call Philosophicall or Civill vertues, and those gifts &amp; good motions which the Spirit of God worketh in the harts of the regenerate. The former, whereof wee haue examples euerie where in prophane histories, both flow from a diuers fountaine, and are also directed vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, so that albeit they are not to be accounted vices, as beeing contrarie and opposite thereunto: yet doe they no way deserue the name of that which is good in deede before God. For they proceeded from a constitution meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and therefore altogither rotten and corrupt: neither doe they reach vnto the glorie of God, which is the end that (as I may say) sanctifyeth all good workes. For how should they make the glorie of God the principall scope of all their cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb facs="tcp:1955:16"/> and actions, who neuer had any knowledge of the true God? Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith trulie of them in the second to the <hi>Ephes.</hi> ver. 12. that they were without God in the world; not as though they were of their stamp, who denie that there is any God at all, but because the worshippers of many Gods which are all false Gods, haue in deede no God, howsoeuer they beeing blinded with superstition imagine otherwise. Now if any man will search more narrowlie into the liues of them, who for their iustice and ciuill vertues are most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie commended amongst the Gentiles, and who, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, both for their religion though false, and for their honest conuersation, are to be preferred before many hypocriticall Christians, he shall finde that the best of them were in part giuen and addicted to some intollerable vices, not but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man hath his faults, but because these vices reigned and had dominion in them. Thus the <hi>Catoes</hi> were drunkards and great vsurers, of which one of them did for lucres sake prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his owne wife, &amp; the other either in a mad furie,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.11. 1. Cor. 5.2</note> or to the end he might be accounted a man of a couragious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible stomacke, killed him selfe with his owne handes. There were in <hi>Cicero</hi> many excellent vertues, yet was the whole course of his life stained with ambition and exceeding vanitie. The <hi>Decij</hi> devoved them selues for the safegard of their cuntrie. Be it that they did it not of any vaineglorie, but for the loue of their cuntrie: yet here they staied and came no further, whereas that onely is well and rightlie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which is loued for God. But I will not stand any longer vpon particular examples. This one thing can in no wise be denied,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> that their best actions are no better to be accounted then sinnes, seeing the holie Ghost pronounceth that to be sinne, whatsoeuer is not done of faith. Yet doe we not say that they are such sinnes, as are done against the law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and common honestie. Farre be it from vs to compare <hi>Catelin</hi> or <hi>Cethegus</hi> with <hi>Cicero, Alcibiades</hi> with <hi>Aristides</hi> or <hi>Pericles▪</hi> farre be it from vs, I say, to compare those things which are greatlie to be praised and esteemed among men, with those which are reprooued by the very law of Nature, and condemned by all good lawes. VVell, will some man say, seeing that that law of Nature &amp; the choise of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb facs="tcp:1955:17"/> or dishonest are of God, yea and are in deede nothing else but the very Law of God, they can not but be good, and consequentlie also those motions and actions must needes be good which are agreeable thereunto. To make answere to this obiection, I graunt that they are good in them selues and haue their beginning from God. But it is one thing to speake of the Law which commaundeth, and another thing of men, to whome the Law prescribeth what is to be done or not to be done. Giue me a man vnregenerate, whose actions and motions are answerable to the prescript of the law, first in the true impulsiue cause, which is the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and loue of God, and then in the end and scope, which is an earnest desire of promoting Gods glorie: if this can be done, I will not denie that a meere naturall man may doe good workes. But it is a thing altogither impossible, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as all mens mindes which are not sanctified by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God, are so impure, that they can not so much as think of the things that are pertaining to God, much lesse well and rightlie will that which the Law of Nature well and rightlie, and to good ende prescribeth. For so the Apostle witnesseth in the second to the <hi>Philip.</hi> vers. 13. that we haue all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both to will and to doe that which is good not of nature, but of the free grace of God, vvhich grace doth not, as the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> hold vs in hand, helpe our abilitie beeing of it selfe, smale &amp; vveake, but vvorketh, &amp; as it vvere createth it in vs beeing none at all, and aftervvard also nourisheth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth and directeth the same. Yea, and that these ciuill and morall vertues are found in diuers men, it is not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to nature, but to the speciall blessing of God, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevving &amp; regenerating them (for this is a grace supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and belongeth onely to the children of God) but restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that natural corruption and mischiefe in such sort, that not onelie they doe not as others, breake out into enormous sinnes, but contrarivvise labour, as much as lyeth in them, to keepe others in order, and by persvvasions or punishments to recall them from vice and naughtinesse. For thus merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie it pleaseth God to deale vvith men, though neuer so vnthankefull, for the preseruation of humane societie, out of vvhich at sundrie times by little and little he gathereth his
<pb facs="tcp:1955:17"/> Church. Nowe the vertues of the godly (such a one as <hi>Iob</hi> is here described vnto vs) proceede from the same fountaines in man, namely, the vnderstanding and the will; but yet they being by special grace cleansed and sanctified, both the mind being in spirite renewed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.23. and the will conformed to holie obedience. For which cause they are called the fruits not of the naturall or carnall man, but of the spirituall man. Neuertheles by reason of the relicks of sinne which remaine in our flesh, and which continuallie fight against the spirite, the workes of the regenerate are farre from that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Lawe requireth; and therefore are not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to be called good, and much lesse of their owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse doe they deserue any rewarde. Nowe then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Iob,</hi> whereas he is here said to haue feared God, the vprightnesse of his minde and honest conuersation of life is discerned from these vertues being onely morally conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Neither is it any marvell that this is ascribed vnto <hi>Job,</hi> seeing he came of the stocke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was a true member of the auncient Church, as hath bene before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And eschewed evill)</hi> No marvell therefore if Satan was so malitiously set against him, seeing that he hated him from his very soule, as to whome the name of euill properly and in the highest degree appertaineth. This manner of speach is vsuall with the <hi>Hebrevves,</hi> as Psalme 34. verse 15. <hi>Eschew evill and doe good:</hi> and in the first of Iohn, verse 20. <hi>Iohn</hi> is said to haue confessed and not to haue denyed that he was not Christ. For although such be the nature of contraries, that by the affirming of the one, the other is vnderstoode to be taken away, so that to vse both, may seeme superfluous: yet here it hath a good grace, &amp; it maketh the speach more effectuall. For it giueth vs to vnderstande, that <hi>Iob</hi> was not slacke in perfourming his duetie, but that he gaue him selfe wholly to the studie of true vertue and godlinesse, in so much that (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> warneth vs) he abstained not only from that which was manifestly euill, but as neere as he could, euen from all appearance of euill.</p>

                  </q> Hitherto you haue heard what manner of man <hi>Job</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:1955:18"/> in him selfe, and with him selfe. Nowe it is further shewed what blessings and benefits God bestowed vpon him, so that they did in a sort labour, as it were, to outgoe one another, Iob in holinesse and obedience towardes God, and God in bountifulnesse and mercie towardes Iob. For godlinesse hath the promise of the life present, and of that which is to come, 1. <hi>Timoth. Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>verse</hi> 8. But this is rightly to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For what had <hi>Job</hi> which he had not freely receiued? Surely if outwarde and bodily goods are the giftes of God, much more are inwarde and spirituall: and if the thinges that are in vs by nature come from God, howe much more is he the authour of those graces, which amend nature &amp; are wrought in vs by his Spirite, such as those were in <hi>Iob,</hi> which we spake of in the former verse. Be it therefore that <hi>Job</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in godlinesse, and that God for this cause plentifullie powred out his blessings vpon him: be it also that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured them selues eche as it were to passe others: yet <hi>Iob</hi> gaue nothing to God which he had not first receiued of God, neither doeth God crowne any thing in <hi>Iob,</hi> but his owne free graces. Nowe this was a singular blessing of God, that <hi>Iob</hi> had so many children, sonnes, and daughters, for as much as it is a certaine kinde of immortality for the parents to liue in their children. Therefore in many places of the Scripture, children are accounted a principall blessing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the Lorde, and it is expressely mentioned in the couenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the 127. Psalme, it is called the inheritance and rewarde of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> For although the propagation of mankinde is continued and preserued by the generall vertue of Gods worde, conteined in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> verse 28. <hi>Encrease and multiplie:</hi> notwithstanding God being as well the gouernour, as the authour of all seconde causes, hath reserued to him selfe the power and gift both of generation in men, and in women of shutting and opening the wombe: which <hi>Iob</hi> well considering, as you shall heare afterwarde, when he vnderstoode of the losse of his children, <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>gaue, and the Lorde hath taken away.</hi> I would to God all Fathers and Mothers would diligently marke this, that acknowledging the procreation of children to be so of nature, that neuerthelesse it is the great blessing of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:18"/> God, they would both vndertake marriage in the feare of God, with calling vpon his blessed name, and afterward liue in the same holily and chastly; render thankes to God for the children he giueth them, and bring them vp in honestie and true religion, to the ende they may be faithfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Gods Church. But we must knowe that this benefite of hauing children, as also other outward blessings, whereof mention is made afterwarde, are not such as of them selues accompanie true pietie. For the wicked oftentimes haue many children and great aboundance of wealth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise the godly want both; and yet God doeth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blesse them and curse these; nay, by that which foloweth you shall perceiue, that Satan had scarcely any fitter instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to vndermine <hi>Iob</hi> withal, then these blessings of God, which being taken from him, it is a wonder that in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict he was not ouerthrowne. Neither doeth Satan onely by depriving men of these outward giftes of God bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation, but in the very enioying of them, he entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth men sundry wayes, by prodigalitie, by ryote, by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse. For which cause <hi>Solomon</hi> wisely asketh of God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue him vnderstanding then riches: and what was it that at the length turned his wisedome into foolishnesse, but his ouermuch wealth and prosperitie? Neither are those verses vnknowen:
<q>
                     <l>Hurtfull goods are wisht in peace and sought for in armour,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>&amp;</hi> Prosperities haue whole families ouer easilie turned.</l>
                  </q> Let vs therefore learne especially to craue those blessings at Gods hand, and to cherish in our selues those giftes of God, by which Satan can take no advantage to assault vs, but whereby we rather may be enabled after the example of <hi>Iob</hi> to vanquish and ouercome Satan.</p>

                  </q> It is not vnknowen that the wealth of the Patriarches stoode vpon husbandrie, which is both the most harmelesse trade, and also most profitable for bodily health. And surely this was esteemed the best kinde of life, till idlenesse and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot had taught some to liue vpon other mens labour, &amp; other to betake them to sundry trades of liuing more hurtfull and lesse necessarie in humane societie. But this came not to
<pb facs="tcp:1955:19"/> passe foorthwith; but a very long time together men of best account laboured in tilling the ground and keeping of cattel, as it is apparant by the histories of all nations, till by litle &amp; litle the matter came to that passe, that these two trades (which none can liue without, though they would neuer so feigne) were left for the basest and simpliest men, and for such as all others might pray vpon. And this bringeth into my minde that which once I sawe painted in a table, where the noble man had this poesie: <hi>By my sword I defend you all:</hi> the Clergie man; <hi>By my prayers I preserue you all:</hi> the countryman; <hi>J feede you all;</hi> lastly the Lawyer; <hi>J devoure you all.</hi> A pretie deuise and happely not vnsitting those times. But in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable age, they may speake after another sorte. The noble man may say, <hi>J robbe and spoyle you all:</hi> the Cleargie man, <hi>J beguile you all:</hi> the Lawyer, <hi>J feede vpon you all:</hi> the country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>J am a pray vnto you all.</hi> Yet it is certaine, as the state of common wealthes are, that neither al men are borne to take paines in husbandrie, nor yet that other vocations are to be left &amp; forsaken, being not only honest, but profitable to the common wealth, and necessary for humane society: among which I would reckon the practise of marchandize, so it be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a good conscience to the profite of the common wealth, though <hi>Chrysostome</hi> among others goe too farre in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fault with this trade.</p>

Now whereas there is mention made of shee asses &amp; camels, &amp; not of horses, it is to be ascribed to the vse of that country, in which they vsed camels to beare burdens, and asses for men to ride on: so that they had small vse of horses among them.

And surely it was a thing greatly to be wondred at, that with such abundance &amp; plentie of all maner of riches there should be ioyned such incomparable vertue. For it is a common &amp; too true a prouerb that <hi>A rich man is either an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust man, or an vniust mans heire.</hi> Yet that riches are not to be condēned, as some fantastically haue imagined, but that they are rather instruments of many good thinges vnto vs, it is a thing so evidēt that it needeth no proofe.

<pb facs="tcp:1955:20"/> solitarinesse. Also they are to be blamed, who whiles they rightly labour to eschewe vaine pompe and superfluitie, fall into the contrarie vice, restraining the vse of dyet and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to an exact and bare necessitie.

And so farre is it, that the feastes of the godly very often in the Scripture and almost euery where spoken of (which, doubtlesse are different from their ordinarie eatings and drinkings) are condemned, that on the contrary part the Lorde willeth his holy guestes in the sacrifices of thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to make good cheare, and to be ioyfull, as in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.

God hath brought horrible famine, warre and pestilence in a manner vpon the whole earth; especially vpon <hi>Fraunce</hi> and the <hi>Lowe countryes:</hi> we see the Churches well nigh oppressed by the aduersaries: <hi>Antichrist</hi> rageth and leaueth no treacherie nor force vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted against <hi>England</hi> and that most gratious QVEENE, which hath bene a refuge and as it were a sanctuarie to a number of poore and miserable exiles: in <hi>Helvetia</hi> the spirit of discorde waxeth ranke: finallie those bloodie <hi>Jebusites</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1955:20"/> strike vp the alarum throughout all Christendome. Al which miseries partly alreadie most worthily fallen vpon vs, and partly hanging ouer our heades, as our great and manifolde sinnes haue procured, so God of his mercie graunt that they may be turned away by our true and speedy repentance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that I may returne to my purpose, when the time of peace and reioysing commeth, we must alwayes take heede of excesse and lavishing; we must vse Gods creatures sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and especially haue a care that our mindes may as well be refreshed with godly talke, as our bodyes with meate and drinke. As for such thinges as either of them selues are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and vnhonest, or through long abuse are growen past remedie, and are therefore iustly accounted among thinges vnlawfull, they are once for all to be banished from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Christians. Of this sorte are very many songes, and daunces of all kindes, which if any man wil goe about in these dayes to bring into a due order or moderation, he shall doe no more then if he endevoured to be mad with reason. Nowe whereas <hi>Iobs</hi> sonnes had seuerall houses to dwel in, one apart from the other, this declareth not only the welthinesse of that family, but also the good order &amp; gouernment thereof: and withall it sheweth that they were of ripe yeres and come to mens estate, although they were as yet vnmarried. All which circumstances commend vnto vs both the carefulnes of the father in bringing vp his children vertuously, and also their dutifull mindes being so willing to be taught, and so ready to take instruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And sent and called their three sisters to eate and to drinke with them]</hi> Here againe we may see <hi>Iobs</hi> wise gouernment, and ordering of his housholde. For the sisters kept not with their brethren, but had their dwelling apart from them, which was both more seemely &amp; more safe, as also more agreeing with maidenly shamefastnesse. Neither is it said, that <hi>Iobs</hi> sonnes sent for any other weomen; yea the sisters come not ouer boldly and vncalled to the bankets of their brethren, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they knewe them to be men of a sober and honest disposition, which the Greeke exposition doeth not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expresse by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If fathers would follow this example especially those of the richer sort, where
<pb facs="tcp:1955:21"/> there is greater loosenes and libertie to sinne, we should see many families better ordered then they are, and we should be free from very many offences.</p>

                  </q> The Greeke interpreter hath translated this place more vnfitlie, vsing for burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, the generall worde <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> somewhat also he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our, as namely that particle <hi>(all)</hi> and he addeth many things of his owne: all which <hi>Jerome</hi> hath rightlie amended according to the truth of the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> text. Now seeing the Greeke translations are in diuerse places faultie, and seeing that in all things we must follow the <hi>Hebrewe,</hi> hereafter we will not much trouble our selues about the Greeke, vnlesse peraduenture we shall finde any thing worthie the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God be thanked that in these daies he hath restored the knowledge of the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> tongue, through ignorance whereof those that are vnskilfull will hardlie beleeue how often and how greatlie the most learned Greeke interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue erred in the true exposition of al the sacred bookes of the old Testament, and especiallie of this; as also very many of the Latin interpreters, after <hi>Jeromes</hi> emendations; but <hi>I</hi> return to the matter. For these things I touch in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against my will, which neuerthelesse I would haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie to be marked of those, who bend them selues to the studie of <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> seeing it hath pleased God in this age to make the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> tongue so familiare vnto vs, least with the Fathers in many places they erre from the true and natural sense of the Scriptures: yet we must alwaies keepe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence which is due to men of such learning and antiquitie. Verilie this is the property of true and vnfeigned loue which alwaies accompanieth true godlines, that it maketh men verie carefull both of them selues and others: and although it be not suspicious; yet it is not at any time so secure, but that it dailie standeth in feare and doubt of mans infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, euen then, when it might seeme not to haue left any part of duetie vnperformed. <hi>Iob</hi> therefore had a quiet and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:21"/> guiltlesse conscience, and without controuersie he tooke great ioy in the godlie agreement of his children, in whome he did also perceiue tokens of their honest disposition, and fruit of their holie education. Yet he knew them to be men, and that young men too. He knew it was no easie matter to keepe a due moderation in mirth. Therefore he did, no doubt, carefullie obserue what was spoken and done in euery one of these bankets: neither trusting them too much, nor distrusting them more then was needefull. And although while the weeke of their making merrie went about, he heard no euill of them (for if he had, surelie he woulde neuer haue staied til the weekes ende) yet he doubted and preuented the worst. For all the daunger is in negligence; by too much care and diligence a man can scarcelie offende in such matters. VVhat then doth <hi>Iob</hi> he waighteth not till the eighth day commeth, but at the ende of the seuenth, he giueth his children warning, that euery one of them should be readie to offer sacrifice to God. What this rite of sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was which <hi>Iob</hi> vsed, we cannot plainlie and particularlie affirme. But out of this place it must especially be obserued, that ceremonial rites had not their beginning in the mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> seeing it cannot be denied, but that sacrifices were in vse immediatelie after the fall, in <hi>Adams</hi> owne familie: and therefore that euen then also there was an order of priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; rite of sacrificing. And againe strait after the deluge we reade that there was a difference of cleane and vncleane beasts, that is, as I take it, of such as might lawfully be offered in sacrifice &amp; which might not be offered, which difference was well knowne to <hi>Noah Gen.</hi> 8.2. But the Lord in the mount <hi>Sinai</hi> did more plainly &amp; fullie declare the whole manner of his outward worship, which was before vnwritten, though it was not inuented &amp; deuised by man, &amp; therfore it wold haue bin corrupted &amp; in the end vtterly abolished, vnles the Lord had in good time precisely set down certein lawes cōcerning those ceremonies: which how necessary a thing it was, may farther appere, in that the people of god could not for al this be restrained from false worship. For such is the crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, that he wil neuer rest in the reuealed will of god. Moreouer we must obserue that al those ceremonies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteining
<pb facs="tcp:1955:22"/> to gods external service, &amp; appointed by God him self both before the law, &amp; vnder <hi>Moses,</hi> were not vaine &amp; idle spectacles to feede the eies, but were holy mysteries, in which as in certaine glasses the fathers should both see them selues to their owne condemnation before God, and also beholde the mercie of God in the promised Messias in time to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, for the confirmation and nourishing of their faith. Therefore it may truely be said that they are belonging both to the Law that condemneth, and to the Gospell that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, the Apostle in plaine words witnessing both the one &amp; the other; namely, that they were in stead of a hand writing against vs, with Christ fastened vpō the Crosse, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. vers. 14. &amp; in the 17. vers. that they were shadowes of things to come, whereof Christ is the body. But nowe by the comming of Christ they are taken away, except onely those 2. most pure Sacraments of the newe couenant. Neuertheles that which was figured by those outward rites of sanctifying, still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, &amp; therefore by these examples of the fathers n the old Testament, we are put in minde that there must goe before our prayers a diligent preparation of the heart, if we desire to be heard: and therefore the Prophet doeth rightly ioyne these two togither, Psal. 26. vers. 6. <hi>J will wash my hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, O Lorde, &amp; compasse thine altar:</hi> And againe in the 33. Psalme, verse 1. <hi>It becommeth vpright men to be thankfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And rose vp earely in the morning]</hi> This circumstance also declareth with howe great care <hi>Iob</hi> did the dutie of a good father, whereby all the godly are admonished both whence they should begin their daily labours (whither also belongeth that continuall morning sacrifice vnder the Lawe) and also to how great daunger they lay them selues open, who either being pricked by their own conscience, or warned by others, or mooued by Gods iudgements, doe yet put off their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance though it be but one minute of an houre. For after the doores of mercie are shut, they may call and crie often, but the Lord will not heare them, Matth. 7. vers. 27. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that saying to all Christians ought to be most pretious, <hi>Make no delayes but take time while it serueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And offered burnt offerings &amp;c.]</hi> He him selfe was the Priest, as then was the custome, in his owne house. And here againe
<pb facs="tcp:1955:22"/> we see that <hi>Iob</hi> was no niggard in the seruice of the true God, as who offered not peace offerings, but burnt offerings, and that according to the number of his sonnes. By which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is reprooued the sparingnes of diuers men in giuing their almes (for the poore are vnto vs in steede of an altar) who are not vnlike to those, who in time past offered in the temple their diseased and scabbed sheepe; whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets most grieuouslie and most iustlie complaine. Of these men the Apostle speaketh in the 2. Epistle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> cap. 9. ve. 6. saying: <hi>He that soweth sparinglie shall reape also sparinglie.</hi> Yet let vs remember that <hi>Iob</hi> was bountifull in the seruice of the true God &amp; not of idoles. For the more a man bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon superstitious worship, the more grieuouslie is God displeased. Notwithstāding true it is that those which were so lauish &amp; prodigall in honouring of their idoles, shal rise vp in iudgement, &amp; by their example condemne the niggardlines of many, who professe them selues to be true Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Job thought, it may be that my sonnes haue sinned]</hi> Loue is not suspitious, as I said before: neither had <hi>Iob</hi> any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest cause why he should suspect any such thing of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and therefore that clause of doubting is added. But that which for the most part falleth out in such bankettings, least also it had happened amongest them, he had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to feare. Wherein he tooke another course, then men commonly are wont to do, who are so farre from accusing, rather then excusing that which is doubtful in their sayings &amp; doings, that quite contrary they leaue not to flatter them selues in very palpable sinnes. Now if <hi>Job</hi> was so carefull to seeke for pardon for the suspected sinnes of others, what doe we thinke he did in his owne case, when he had at any time offended God. And again, what an excellent example is here offred vnto vs, that one of vs in true loue should procure the salvation of another? The which dutie of loue hath somtimes bene available to deliuer many from dangers who were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnworthy, as we read of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Gen. 18.22. &amp; of the whole people of God. Esa. 59. v. 16. sometimes also hath deliuered them, as it befel vnto those which were in the same ship with Paul. Act. 27. v, 24. Here that also is to be obserued, that by the word <hi>(Sinned)</hi> in this place is not meant whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:1955:23"/> is not so done as it ought, or that wherein a man howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth offend (for who is he that doth not thus sinne euen vnwittingly?) but hereby <hi>Iob</hi> would signifie that in these ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kettings somewhat might happily haue escaped his children, by which they might greatly haue offended the maiestie of God. But why doth he offer for euery one of his sonnes? For it might be that some one of them had transgressed, the rest not being priuy therto. I agree; but the most holy man would not so neerely and cunningly debate the matter with God, knowing that there was cause sufficient, why he should need to craue mercy both for himselfe, &amp; for euery particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in his houshold. And as he was a mā of a very tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, so he was not ignorant that not they alone are guilty of sinne, who haue themselues transgressed either in word or deed, but they also who are any way consenting, &amp; cōsequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who reproue not those whom they see offend. Therefore when <hi>Naboth</hi> was accused, though wrongfully, of blasphemy against God and the King, the Israelites albeit at that time they were fallē away frō the true God, did not without good cōsideration proclaime a fast, 1. king. 21.12. And <hi>Paul</hi> sharply reprehendeth the <hi>Corinth.</hi> for that they were not publikely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for the incest of one vngodly person amongst them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And blasphemed God in their hearts)</hi> According to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thus, <hi>And haue blessed god in their harts,</hi> yet the meaning is all one. For it is a cōmon thing with the <hi>Hebrues</hi> to vse words by a contrary signification, when the proper worde signifieth some hainous matter, such as scarcely ought to be named: as the Latins vse this word <hi>(sacrū)</hi> which signifieth holy or sacred for <hi>(execrandū)</hi> that is, prophane ordetestable. Now that is not without cause added, <hi>In their harts,</hi> because if <hi>Iob</hi> had neuer so litle suspected, that his sōnes had cōmitted any such offence in word or deed, he would not haue spared any rebukes and chastisemēts. Neither is this to be vnderstood of that execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy, but only of Gods honour empaired by some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister thought &amp; affection. Here we may gather that not only those things which we speak or do otherwise then we ought, but euē the very lightest motiōs of the mind are to be accoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for sinnes: &amp; therfore that all sinnes (albeit they be vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall) do of them selues &amp; without Christ, with God, against
<pb facs="tcp:1955:23"/> whose maiestie they are committed, deserue eternall death, seeing we shall giue account of euery idle and vnprofitable word. Which quite ouerthroweth that false and damnable distinction made by the schoole sophisters, of sinnes <hi>Veniall</hi> &amp; sinnes <hi>Mortal,</hi> being vnderstoode after their owne doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus did Iob euery day)</hi> That is, so often as his sonnes thus by turnes feasted one another. Neither yet is it to be douted, but that otherwise Gods seruice was daily celebrated in this holie familie, &amp; especiallie euery seuenth day kept holie vnto the Lord, as God had appointed from the beginning of the world, Gen. 2.3. But herby also is shewed, that <hi>Iobs</hi> zeale was not vnconstant, soone hot &amp; soone cold, neither that this his holy care ouer his familie was vndertaken onely for fashions sake. VVherunto is to be referred that admonition so often repeated in the holie Scriptures, that we should pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie and neuer be wearie of well doing.</p>

                  </q> Hitherto we haue heard what <hi>Job</hi> did here vpon the earth: now is set downe, what the Lord decreed about these things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The declaration wherof how necessarie it is, appeareth both by that earnest disputation between <hi>Job</hi> &amp; his friends, and also <hi>Iobs</hi> lamentable complaint, each of them springing from no other cause, but from the ignorance of gods decree. For although no man at any time (except a few men quite voide of reason, &amp; going stiflie against the testimonie of their owne conscience) denyed that all things created were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden and ruled by Gods prouidence: notwithstanding herein we see that which the Apostle trulie witnesseth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. what befalleth men trusting to their owne wisdome, nothing but this, that they become vaine in their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. VVho knoweth not the wicked opinion of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi> attributing all things to the concourse or meeting of their small motes which they call <hi>Atomi?</hi> who knoweth not that the <hi>Stoicks</hi> sliding from one extreame to another, haue tied god by the chaines as it were, of midle &amp; secondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? who knoweth not that the <hi>Peripatericks</hi> the wittiest of all the rest, haue shut out the euēt of al things from Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Neither haue these things bene debated onely in the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:24"/> schooles of prophane men, but euen in the schoole of God; not whether the world were gouerned by Gods prouidence: whether hee freely, &amp; as it best pleaseth him selfe, yet alwaies iustlie, disposeth and ordereth the second causes and effects of the same: finallie whether his heauenlie power and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king extend it selfe to euery particular thing, euen to the meanest and basest that can be thought of; these things, I say, haue not beene called into question (for thereof scarcely any but vngodly &amp; very prophane wretches haue euer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) but of these two maine points hath beene al the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie: first, how it might stand with Gods iustice and equitie that the estate of good men should in this life, be so wretched and miserable: and contrariwise, the condition of the wicked, be so ioyfull and prosperous: secondlie, if nothing be done, but that which God willeth and decreeth from all eternitie (for he hath not decreed any thing either within the limits of time, because he chaungeth not, Malach. 3.6. and <hi>with him there is no variablenes nor shadowing by turning.</hi> Iam. 1.17. or against his will, because he is omnipotent) how we might free him from beeing the author of sinne, whome neuertheles we know to be an enemie &amp; reuenger of al iniquitie. About this argument the most holie and exercised seruants of God haue had their mindes distracted into diuers and contrarie cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as it appeareth particularlie in the 73. Psal. of <hi>Asaph.</hi> Habacuk. 2. Ieremie. 15. vers. 10. And that we goe no further, in this very booke those things which are alleadged on either side, and by which <hi>Iobs</hi> friends are caried beyond the truth, yea, and <hi>Job</hi> him selfe is well nigh driuen to forget all patience, doe sufficientlie shew that this is one of Satans chiefe sleyts and practizes against vs, seeking either out of hand and at once to ouerthrow the foundation of our faith and hope, or else by little and little to shake and weaken it, that he may in the end bring vs to dispaire. Seeing therefore that both these weightie questions are in this short descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perspicuouslie and plainlie laid forth and confirmed by a most graue witnesse, namelie, by the expresse wordes of <hi>Iob,</hi> in this chapter and the next, which were put into him by the holie Ghost; this place is worthie to be diligentlie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatelie handled. But here are certaine things before seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
<pb facs="tcp:1955:24"/> to be obserued. And first of all, whie these heauenlie matters are set out after an earthlie manner, that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vse and custome of men. Secondlie what things they are, which in this figuratiue description are spoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of men, which cannot without impietie be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed properlie to God. In the third place I will vnfold the particular things represented in this description.</p>
               <p>To beginne with the first; God to prouide for the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of man, from the beginning, as it were, visiblie reuealed vnto the Fathers his grace (which neither can nor ought any otherwise to be apprehended, then by the eye of the minde; because the instrument of conceiuing things spirituall, must of necessitie be spirituall) by certaine visions represented to the outward senses, as it is euident by manifold places of the sacred Scriptures. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Patriarkes hauing learned the true knowledge of God, as also they who had receiued the same by tradition from them, were lifted vp beyond these corporall visions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of things heauenlie and celestial; especiallie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other visions were both by night and by day exhibited to the Prophets, by which the people of God were instructed, that they might easilie vnderstand the true vse of such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. But after that the knowledge of the true God began by little and little to be forgotten, &amp; that the deuills by Gods iust iudgement against men, tooke vpon them to send effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall illusions and vaine apparitions to beguile men withall, it came to passe, that men were no longer by these bodilie visions caried higher, namely, to consider of heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but contrariwise, not content to haue deuided one God into many, they transformed their Gods into the natures and properties of men. And yet neuerthelesse this generall principle still remained inuiolate (except happelie any men grew past all reason) that whatsoeuer was done here vpon earth, was first decreed in heauen that it should so come to passe. Hence are those fictions in <hi>Homer</hi> and others that followed his steppes, as namely that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                  <q>Panditur interea domus Omnipotentis Olympi.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But these things which are of them deciphered after a prophane manner, as they are in the holie Scriptures hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:1955:25"/> very reuerentlie, so are they referred to a good and holie end; of which sort are those descriptions in the sixt of Esay, Eze. 1. &amp; 1. King. 22.19. &amp; this also which now we haue in hād, sauing that in the former the Lord appeareth onely to his Prophets, but here are set forth things done in the presence and hearing of many, and that a farre off in the tribunal seat of God, as it were in the pallace of the high <hi>Emperour.</hi> Now in the second place let vs see, what in this figuratiue descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is spoken after the vse of men, which doth not any way agree properlie to God. Of this sort is that especiallie, that these things were set down to be done vpon a certain day; as though with god there were certen leet daies, in which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were heard before his tribunal seat: that God is brought in, as it were some mightie king, hauing his gard of Angels about him: that Satan also is said to haue come thither, and that God questioned with him about this and that. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, almightie God is alwaies and euery where present and disposerh all things: all things both in heauen and in earth are at all times in his sight, neither needeth he to make any enquirie into matters, who beholdeth the things that are to come; seeing nothing shalbe, yea, and nothing can be, which he hath not appointed and determined. Neuerthelesse true it is, that whatsoeuer God hath in him selfe before all times and from eternitie decreed, the same he reuealeth both to his Angels, whome he vseth as ministers to execute his wil, and also to men, when and in what manner it seemeth good vnto him. And it is not vnlikelie, that by this meanes the deuills oftentimes foretold in those their oracles what should afterward come to passe. Therefore these things are not so to be vnderstood, as if they agreed to God in deede, no more then a mouth, handes, feete, and actions belonging to men, as namelie to speake, to come, to depart, to be angrie, to repent; al which notwithstanding are ascribed to god: but the things which we were not able otherwise to conceiue, are as it were by these resemblāces represented vnto vs. It remaineth now to shew, what may profitably be collected out of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. For this is the third thing which we propounded.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is in this historie recorded, that <hi>Iob,</hi> such a man by Gods owne testimonie, as for iustice and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:1955:25"/> none at that time was like vnto him, furnished with all manner goods both of bodie and minde, suddenlie fell into so extreame miserie and wretchednes, lest any man might i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that this came to passe, as prophane men vse to say, by chaunce, as if the world were tossed to and fro, I know not by what violence of blinde fortune, or least by this suddeine chaunge any should gather (as both his wife and his friends most falslie surmised) that all <hi>Iobs</hi> holinesse and integritie, was but meere hypocrisie, which God afterward punished in so seuere manner: finallie, least the godlie might want an example, whereby they might comfort them selues in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whereunto in this life they of al men are most subiect, as the experience of all ages doth sufficientlie witnesse, it was necessarie that these things should first be set downe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should heare of that narration and discourse which followeth; to the end our mindes might be prepared to resist such prophane cogitations. Here therefore in briefe we are taught, that nothing is done here vpon the earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goe well with the godlie or ill with the wicked, or contrariwise, which God hath not most iustlie and wiselie decreed from all eternitie for his owne glorie, and both for the profit of the godlie and the iust vengeance of the wicked.</p>
               <p>And here againe we learne another secret, which maketh very much for the exhibiting of due reuerence to God and patient bearing of the greatest calamities that may befall vs, namely, that God, whether he vse good or badde instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, alwaies dealeth iustlie, and that it cannot otherwise be, but that, if we wil patiently attend the end of Gods work, which may be vnto vs vnknovvne, but neuer vniust, the thing it selfe shal make vs acknovvledge, that he is a louer of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, vvhich he blesseth, and a hater of iniquitie, vvhich he so seuerelie punisheth, as the vvise man teacheth vs, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. <hi>verse</hi> 10. &amp; 11. &amp; 12.16. And lastlie here vve are taught, that the furie both of Satan and of all the vvicked, vvherevvith they are caried against the children of God, is so brideled by the povver and vvill of God, that they cannot goe about, much lesse effect any thing, but onely so farre forth as God giueth them leaue, and this is alvvaies done for the good
<pb facs="tcp:1955:26"/> and profit of the godlie, whether he chasten them or prooue them for his owne glorie &amp; their good, as in the end he will make knowne vnto them: whether he set the wicked one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, or by any other meanes togither with Satan bring them to their deserued destruction. Now after what sort these things may so be reconciled with Gods nature, that he neither be made the author of sinne, nor yet may rightlie be thought to swerue one iot from that eternal &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable rule of his iustice, shalbe shewed in the 21. verse of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>These things being thus set down, let vs come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular expounding of the words of the text: <hi>Now on a day when &amp;c.</hi> I would not haue this preciselie to be taken for some one day of the feasts, as namly that, in which <hi>Iobs</hi> children eating &amp; drinking in their eldest brothers house, by the fall thereof were all slaine. But touching this point, in respect of God him selfe, we must know that he in his gouernment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of all things is not shut vp within any spaces of time, as vvho hath created and ordeined times and seasons not for him self, but for things which in time were created, &amp; togither vvith the time are subiect to change &amp; alteration. And moreouer this is most certen, that God doth not decree any thing within the limits &amp; cōpasse of time, but that things both in generall and in particular, both all and euery one, haue beene foreappointed and determined by the secret and immutable counsell of God, euen from all eternitie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding as he hath before the foundation of the vvorld decreed all things: so he hath set and assigned the times or seasons, vvhich he hath put in his ovvne povver, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. vvhen euery thing shall come to passe, euen as him selfe hath appointed: neither is it possible that these times should either be hastened or protracted one minute. Therefore God in this place is not brought in, as if novv he tooke some nevv coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell concerning <hi>Iob</hi> (for he had ordeined all things from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting) but the time novv beeing come, vvhich he prefixed for the actuall accomplishing of that he had decreed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed the same to Satan, beeing before altogither ignorant thereof, as vvhome he had appointed to be the chiefe instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in executing this his vvill and purpose.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1955:26"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The children of God]</hi> So it is euident by very many places of Scripture that those blessed spirits are seperated from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impure spirits, which stood not stedfast in the truth: and are called the sonnes of God, both by reason of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull blessing vpon them (because to parents nothing can be more deare then their children) and also for that moste glorious excellencie, as to whome therefore those notable titles of powers, vertues and principalities are attributed by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.21. and in other places. That likewise is euident, that the same title, albeit not for like reason, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Magistrates in respect of the great authoritie which they haue ouer others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.6. finallie God doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe that most honourable title to his Saints chosen out of this worlde, both for that exceeding wonderfull adoption, <hi>John.</hi> 1.12. as also for that eternall glorie and incorruption, in which they shalbe as the Angels which are in heauen, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12. <hi>verse</hi> 25. and fellowe heires with Christ him selfe. But all these appellations are to be distinguished and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their true &amp; proper vse. Therefore as touching those blessed spirits, they are set out vnto vs, as beeing bewtifyed with a certaine excellent and heauenly glorie; yet onely as Gods ministers, and that also to the benefit and seruice of his saints, so farre as it pleaseth God to vse their ministrie. They are not therefore propounded vnto vs, that we should cal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or worship them, which thing the Apostle expresly forbiddeth, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. (for they are our fellow seruants, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.10. and 22.9.) but partly that we should glorifie God with them in holy agreement &amp; common songs of thanksgiuing, and partly that we may be continually mindfull of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesurable goodnes towards vs, wherby it commeth to passe, that he defendeth vs by the ministerie of those blessed spirits both against Satan and other our aduersaries, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.14. which is also by many holie examples and histories of Scripture declared: finallie, that remembring his seruant <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeus</hi> of whome mention is made 2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.16. &amp; <hi>Iacobs</hi> vision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. we may more valiantly perseuere in all our wordly warfare. Neither is it to be douted, but that as God hertofore defended his Church by Angels, in that miserable slauerie, from infinite daungers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.20. &amp; 11.1. so now also he doth
<pb facs="tcp:1955:27"/> defend vs miraculouslie from Antichrist and the conspiracie of the whole world: somtime by confounding their language, otherwhile by ouerthrowing tyrants, sometime from heauen laughing our enemies to scorne, sometime by blessing godlie Kings &amp; Princes, yea, &amp; miraculously preseruing Queenes, nourcing mothers of the Church; wherof if euer there was a manifest example, now it is to be seen in that thrise excellent princesse Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whom Gods singular prouidence hath deliuered from the infinite entrappings of <hi>Satan,</hi> Antichrist and the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> euen in our age, and whome we trulie may call the common sanctuarie &amp; refuge of the afflicted Church. And I pray you since the first ciuill warres stirred vp in <hi>France</hi> by those chosen instruments of the deuil, who can doubt but that those worthie men protectors of the <hi>French</hi> Churches, were assisted &amp; garded by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? Neither surely may we think that they were then forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, when as in the last conflict being taken into heauen they departed. And truly at this time no humane force, but plaine heauenlie &amp; extraordinarie, doth safe keepe this heroicall &amp; worthie king of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the safegard of the <hi>French</hi> Church; and the noble Prince of <hi>Condye,</hi> against those wicked cutthrotes, conspiratours and enemies both to the Church and kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> But this honourable title giuen to Magistrates hitherto apperteineth, not that we transferre the least iot of Gods honour to them (for onelie God is the lawgiuer to our conscience, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.12.) but that we obey them as Gods officers, so farre as their authority stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, not for necessitie, but for conscience sake, that is, not for the auoiding of punishment set downe by mans lawes, but because God him selfe doth rule in his ministers; we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, I say, meekely and of our owne accord, without any preiudice to Gods right, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.2. &amp;c. &amp; that we earnestlie pray for them, as the mainteyners and defenders of the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace: which duties are euen to prophane Princes and heathen gouernours in like manner to be performed. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Moreouer the true vse of this title of the <hi>Children of God</hi> attributed vnto vs, is threefold. One, that we may oppose this dignitie to the ignominie of the Crosse, and to all those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes which we suffering for the righteousnes of God, are
<pb facs="tcp:1955:27"/> made conformable to Christ our head, beeing not onely not discouraged vnder the crosse of Christ, but euen rejoysing, as we are taught by the precepts and examples of the Prophets and Apostles. Another is, that remembring the greatnes of Gods benefit in this our adoption, we may giue him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall thanks. The third, that we beeing the sonnes of such a father, and the brethren of such an elder brother, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to forget what our duetie is to both, either as sonnes, or as brothers, and to greeue the holie Spirite of adoption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. but rather that we may shun that grieuous repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Jf I be a father where is my honour? if a Lord, where is my feare?</hi> To conclude, this title is to be obserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who blasphemouslie say that the eternall sonne of God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.1.2. &amp;c. and 5.20. and that onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not rashly so called, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14.18. &amp; 3.16.18. &amp; 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.9. had a beginning in time, before which he was not: and the wicked <hi>Rabbines</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who dreame of a Messias crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the world was made: whome we doubt not as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to thinke him coequall and coessentiall with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and as one God with the Father and the holie Ghost with the same worship to be honoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Came and stood]</hi> One way are men and bodilie creatures moouing them selues, said to come, another way spirits, and another way God. For corporall things doe come and goe circumscriptiuelie, and trulie chaunging places, as they say: neither can it better be, that a true bodie may be in more places togither, or otherwise then locallie and definitiuelie, wheresoeuer its essence is, then it can be, that a bodie be no bodie; no not Christs body excepted, though neuer so much glorifyed, and now not abiding in earth, but placed in the highest heauens: of which <hi>Augustin</hi> disputing saith, <hi>If a bodie, then in a place, by reason of the nature of a true bodie.</hi> VVherefore transsubstantiation and consubstantiation, and much more that <hi>vbiquitie</hi> of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> by which the truth of Christs as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension and his comming from heauen, yea and the very truth of Christs bodie is by a plaine contradiction quite ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, are by some defended of a blockish ignorance, by others onelie of inexcusable obstinacie. But the Angells of whome here is peculiar mention, are said to be in a place:
<pb facs="tcp:1955:28"/> yet <hi>equivocè,</hi> that is, after another manner then bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touch of a mesurable quantitie, which is not at all in thē, but definitiuelie, because their essence is not infinite. Hence also it commeth, that therefore they can no more be in many places at once, then bodilie substances: neither yet is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that two Angels should definitiuely be in one and the same place togither. Hereof it is, that according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of places, rightlie and properlie God is saide to sende them, and they to be sent, and to goe and come; as, before the schoole men, auncient diuines, especiallie <hi>Didymus</hi> and <hi>Basil</hi> prooued by Scriptures, writing against those hereticks, who mainteined impious opinions concerning the holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. But here that may be demaunded, from what place god is said to send them. I answere that in such mysteries we are not to be wise aboue that which is meete. Neuertheles, sith Angels are rightlie called heauenlie, I say it may be lawfullie set downe, that they haue allotted them to a dwelling place aboue the heauens them selues, full of light and glorie, such as wee are not once able to conceiue (into which, in very deede, and without any figuratiue kind of speach, Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ascended, from whence also he shall come at the last day, and into which we shall then in soule and bodie be actuallie taken, to reigne with him and those blessed spirits for euer.) Trulie therefore and without any <hi>Metaphor</hi> they are said to be sent from heauen to execute the will of God; neither is this a vaine &amp; fantastical opinion, as many euen in our age, placing heauen &amp; hell euery where, most monstrously haue taught, being in very deed themselues rather to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fantasticall. Neither yet do we recken vp degrees &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Angells with <hi>Dionysius,</hi> or curiously search what they doe: which things wee can not by searching attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. If further it be obiected; Sith God is euery where, how then are they said to come to him or to goe from him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that this is a distinct question from the former. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they are properlie and without any <hi>Metaphor</hi> said to goe and come, not by reason of any limited quantitie, but by the proprietie of their finite nature, and also in respect of the distance of places, to which they come and from which they goe: so in regard of Gods sending them, who of him selfe is
<pb facs="tcp:1955:28"/> infinite, they goe from place to place, so that neuerthelesse they can not be said at any time to be absent from God. But because God, albeit being euery where, not only in his works, but also in essence, incomprehensible and comprehending al things; yet for a peculiar and proper respect is said to be in the heauens, for that in them he both setteth out vnto vs his incomparable glory, and after a secret and spiritual manner ruleth that most glorious part of his kingdome: therfore also the Angels euery where in the Scriptures are set downe, not onely to see the <hi>Fathers</hi> face, but to see it in heauen, and to be sent from God out of the heauens, and to descend from his throne, and to ascend and returne againe into heauen, and in heauen to praise and glorifie God. But God him selfe after two sorts is said to goe and come, to ascend and descende, to be present and absent. One, in the three persons equallie in one and the same common substance, &amp; that in resemblance of those affections which are in man, namly, as he either exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth his iudgemēts, or vseth his mercy: which thing I need not to prooue by alleadging places of Scripture, seeing euery where they offer them selues. Another way, in the proper &amp; peculiar persō of the <hi>Word,</hi> that is, in respect of our humane nature personally taken and vnited to it: to which because he is not simply present, as to other thinges created; or to his elect and saintes, (as <hi>Nestorius</hi> deuiding Christes person falsly mainteined) but it is so present, that that humanitie, which he tooke, is not subsistent in it selfe, but in the person of the <hi>Word:</hi> therfore he is said to haue come in the flesh, to haue come down vnto vs in the forme of a seruāt, to haue bin made Man, the properties of either nature yet stil remaining without any confusion (namely of the nature assuming in the person of the <hi>Word,</hi> or the nature assumed in that person subsisting.) Therefore by reason of this vnion, from which proceedeth the vnitie of Christes person, neither is the <hi>Worde</hi> shut vp within the straightes of his humane bodie and soule, neither doth the assumed humanitie, beeing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered such as it is by this coniunction with the Godheade, exceede the limits of its circumscribed dimentions and place, being neuer so much glorified. And whosoeuer dreame that the two natures must of necessitie be pulled a sunder,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:29"/> vnlesse, wheresoeuer the deitie of the <hi>Word</hi> is (and that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where) there also the humanity assumed with the whole bodelie essence be present, they not onely falslie, but foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conclude: which matter I haue often before this time, and at large handled out of this place. But this I will adde to the former, that this vnion of the <hi>Word</hi> with the assumed nature, is to be distinguished, both from the essential presence &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as wel of good spirits in borrowed bodies, as of vncleane spirits in those who are possessed by them, as also from the coniunction of the soule with mans bodie. For that is such, as those spirits together with the bodies in which they are, doe not make one subsistent and entire thing: for in men posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with diuels, two subsistences do alwaies actuallie remain. In like manner, bodies taken by blessed spirits, are onely for a time the instruments belonging to those spirits, by the which spirits they are mooued vp and down, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of some speciall seruice enioyned them of God; so that Angels cannot properlie be saide to haue taken mans whole nature, or to become Man. Now the felowship of the soule with euery seuerall mans bodie, is in deede personall (for so all humane persons are made, and thus farre <hi>Athanasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vseth this similitude) but it is sufficient that those two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to make a third thing compounded of those two parts, as making a whole and an entire thing, beeing seuerallie in themselues imperfect; cōpounded, I say, as of a matter (which is the bodie) and a forme (which is the soule:) and therefore of this composition the whole ariseth. But the humanitie which the sonne of God took, cannot as a part be compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Godhead of the <hi>Word</hi> taking it: to which for the encreasing it, nothing can be added, and from which, to the diminishing therof, nothing can be taken, &amp; with which as with the onlie infinite essence nothing can in that māner be conioyned, which deitie, to conclude, cannot without great absurditie be called the forme of any creature. It remaineth then that the vnion of the person of the <hi>Word</hi> with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie assumed, be called <hi>hypostatical,</hi> so farre as it is graūted to the humanitie to be coupled with the diuinitie, and not to subsist in it selfe, but in the <hi>Word,</hi> in that subsistent, which the very Angels cannot behold nor comprehend, called <hi>Jmma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1955:29"/> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, God with man. But hereof perhaps too much, if we consider what belongeth to this place, &amp; yet not too much in respect of old heresies newly polished &amp; set abroach in this our age. Now returne we to our angels again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And stood before the Lood]</hi> This standing doth not signifie a bare presence, seeing to God all things at all times are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but both their ordinary function, and also a most readie minde in them to discharge whatsoeuer belongeth to their office and dutie, which is neuer found in those vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as who doe not euen then obey the will of God, when they doe his commaundement, and who, as it is to be seen in this storie, do not truelie, so much regard Gods authority, as they greedilie catch at the power and licence which is giuen them to doe ill. Therefore this obedience in the blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is highlie commended, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Hitherto also belongeth, that they haue appeared with wings, and those wings for the most part were foure in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (which things the Poets feygned of their prophane <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>) and that, as the Lord plainlie witnesseth in the 18. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> they alwaies behold the face of the Father which is in heauen, thereby condemning our slownes and dulnes in performing our duties. But this is also to be marked, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God doth not vse their ministerie as if he needed their seruice in manner of kings and Princes, who alone, though they would, can doe but little. For he alone is perfect and all sufficient. And verelie as he created the world and al things therein, not vpon any necessitie, neither to take any profit thereby, but as he was most good, that their might be some thing which he might make partaker of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and in which he might be acknowledged, not for any commodities sake, which by encrease may redound to him selfe the creator, but contrariwise, which might be to their commoditie which should acknowledge him: so also he made those blessed spirits in whome men might vew and beholde his power, might, wisdome and goodnes much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie then they can in this visible world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan came also among them)</hi> That there is an huge multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of vncleane spirits, it appeareth by the legion of diuells. which possessed one man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.9. But here also as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:1955:30"/> matters, wee are to beware, that we keepe our selues within the compasse of Gods word. This surelie is manifest, that they haue some prince among them, who in special cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. is called, <hi>Diabolus</hi> the deuill, and both in this and other places is termed Satan: both which titles bewray his desire and disposition. For <hi>Diabolus</hi> signifieth an accuser, and <hi>Satan,</hi> a deadlie and sworne enemie, as we may see 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.14. and <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 8. Neither is he onely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser and enemie of mans saluation, but of God also, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of Christ, as beeing the head of the Church, which he euermore seeketh to hurt. For how can he warre with Gods seruants, without taking armes against their master? Both which things doe not in any historie more clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, then in the description of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, where he setting both vpon God the workeman, and vpon man, Gods most excellent workemanship, the one he ouercame by belying of his maker, and from the other hee estraunged him selfe more and more. And without doubt God had respect vnto this euerlasting and vnreconcileable enmitie euen where, (setting vp a gallowes as it were for the Deuil) he saith, <hi>J will put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, Gen.</hi> 3.15. Therfore it is said that Satan himselfe came, but not as one of the sonnes of God, but among them, to wit, not with the same mind that they came; no out of doubt, but drawn thither vtterly against his will, to the ende we may know that he with all his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels the ministers of his malice, by their rebellion can not exempt them selues from Gods authoritie and iurisdiction. Therefore euen he also was present him selfe, and is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in Gods presence (wholly inraged and set on fire to do mischeefe, yea and swelling in hatred and mallice against good men) but very sore against his wil, and onely to obteine licence to do harme, of him without whose leaue he can not go about, much lesse effect any thing, as appeareth by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the swine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 31. But, will some man say, doth God vse his helpe, which doth nothing at any time but that which is euill, being himselfe alwaies most iust? yea truly. Not that God doth any thing vniustly, but he vseth him, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so wicked, as a tormentor, that is, some time to destroy &amp; subuert the wicked, as <hi>Saule, Sam.</hi> 16.14. as <hi>Judas, Ioh.</hi> 13.2. and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:30"/> many others: sometime to chasten his seruants, as that womā who had her bodie bowed togither, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.16. or else to trie and exercise them, as <hi>Job</hi> in this storie. In accomplishing the wil of God herein, so often as Satan with his imps doe as it were put to their helping hands, they are not to be thought to doe it of any dutieful &amp; obedient minde, but that they are delighted with that destroying power, that god giueth them, to hurte and anoy his creatures. This doctrine is full of excellent comforte. For thereby we vnderstand, that by the power of our God, the rage of that hungrie lion is abated and bridled, and that God will neuer suffer him to doe any thing against his children, which shall not be to their good and profit, as the Apostle telleth vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verse</hi> 28. and also teacheth vs by his owne example, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17.</p>

He therefore asketh nothing as if he were ignorant; neither yet doth he in like manner question with this impure spirit as in time past with <hi>Adam</hi> saying, <hi>Adam where art thou? Gen.</hi> 3.9. and with <hi>Caine, Where is thy brother Abel? Gen.</hi> 4.9. He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of thē as if he knew not, but to bring the one to the path way of saluation, by the acknowledging and detesting of his sinne: the other to destruction, by condemning him selfe by the testimonie of his owne mouth. But these things are spoken after the manner of men, that wee may know that Satan himselfe is cōstrained euē now to appeare before God, as his most iust iudge, to whome he is to giue account of all his wickednes: and also to the end by this example we may learne, that so often as God vseth these ill instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he putteth not into them any inclination to euill (for that they haue of themselues through their corruption) but he doeth as it were stirre vp the same, the which he doth iustlie and wel vse afterward, be the instrument neuer so euil. Neuerthelesse those euill instruments, by them selues and of themselues, work wickednesse euen then, when God rightly and iustlie vseth them, and shal be iustly punished in the end,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:31"/> for that they doe the good and righteous worke of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustlie, and not with that affection which they ought. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 48.10.</p>

                  <hi>And Satan answered the Lorde saying, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it.)</hi> In deede doeing that which here he dissembleth, but Saint Peter telleth vs in his first Epistle, Chap. 5. verse 8. that he walketh about like a roaring Lyon, seeking whome he may deuoure: exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing tyrannie vpon the world which hath willingly taken his yoke: in which sense he is called the prince of this world, &amp; his angells wordlie gouernours. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. but yet God still bridleth and restraineth their tyrannie. But here againe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we are to take heed, that we labour not to be wiser then the word of God will haue vs.</p>

But God thus speaketh to sting him, and as it were triumphing ouer his aduersarie. For nothing greeueth the wicked so much, as that they are not able to bring to passe and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish that which they goe about; As if God should say; Satan I am not ignorant whereabout thou goest, but howsoeuer thou hast sped with others, yet at the length thou hast found a man, euen this <hi>Iob,</hi> about whome all this while thou haste laboured in vaine.</p>

                  </q> Set how crookedlie this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent creepeth, neuer going straight, but dissembling what he could not denie; as they also are wont to doe who are led by this spirite, Sophisters especiallie, transferring their talke from that which is in question to other quiddities. So at
<pb facs="tcp:1955:31"/> this day, when we aske of the aduersary, whether the papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call congregation be the Church, they beginne to dispute of the Churches authoritie. And when Consubstantiation or Transsubstantiation or the vbiquitie of Christs bodie is denyed, the Sophisters in steede of an answere, propound a question, whether God be not omnipotent, or whether Christs words be not of them selues to be beleeued. So the aduersaries beeing conuicted by the authoritie of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, doe make that common place of the traditions of the Church, a generall answere to all controuersies. But to the matter; Satan spite of his nose acknowledging that to be true, which God had propoūded, yet doth not only not yeald to the truth (for how can the author of lyes doe that?) but also seeketh an occasion of a new quarrell, hoping that he may daunt him by aduersity, whome prosperitie could not change; so that not without cause <hi>Paul</hi> warneth vs, that we haue to do with such enemies, as assayle vs both on the right and left hand, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.7. And here marke me, what can be more bolde and impudent then this our aduersarie? by how much the lesse wee may maruell at such as are lead with his spirit. For when he had heard euen from gods own mouth, who cannot lye, that <hi>Iobs</hi> pietye was true and vnfeigned, yet durst he on the contrary fide falsly accuse <hi>Job,</hi> as one not louing God sincerely, but onely for his commodities sake; which was all one as if he should haue charged God to his face either with ignorance or with falshod, when as not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men them selues, are ignorant, that those can not be said to be true friends, which measure friendship by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate gayne, and to whome that olde prouerbe agreeth, <hi>No pennie, no Pater noster.</hi> But to <hi>Iob</hi> how great injurie this slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer doeth, the thing it selfe afterwarde declared, both to the great glory of <hi>Iob</hi> the vanquisher, and the shame of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the assayler. Such is commonly the end of all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations stirred vp by Sathan against the true seruants of God.</p>

                  </q> Here againe the monstrous impudencye of the vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite openeth it selfe, who not content that he had gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb facs="tcp:1955:32"/> the witnesse of God him selfe, as concerning <hi>Job,</hi> nowe also dareth confirme his false slaunder, being the head ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of all <hi>Sophisters,</hi> with a playne sophisme, arguing as they say <hi>A non causa pro causa,</hi> that is, putting that for a cause which in deed is no cause. For what manner of conclusion is this? Thou gardest and standest about <hi>Job</hi> and his family, and heapest all thy blessings vpon him: therefore <hi>Iob</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, loueth, and obeyeth thee, not for thy sake, but for his owne. Two other wayes also Satan here bewrayeth his disposition; being enflamed with continuall envie, and cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a desire to doe mischiefe. For whence come all these things, but because he is now grieued with the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous estate of <hi>Iob,</hi> as in time past he was at the happinesse of our first parents? And to what ende tend these practises, but to shewe his malice in throwing downe <hi>Iob</hi> from that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which he enioyed? And these things are daily and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be thought of, and considered of vs, partly that wee the better acquaint our selues with the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of this our enemie, to the ende we may haue it in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter detestation, and partly that we more warily shunne and avoyde the sleightes of <hi>Sophisters,</hi> who are nothing else but the very mouth and tongue of the deuill, lying in wayte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the trueth, and against our salvation. Besides we are here to weigh diligently what this lying spirit saith, not that we are to learne the trueth of the father of lyes (for it can not be denyed but that they are true and excellent thinges which he doeth vtter) but to refell him by the wordes of his owne mouth. For seeing that this foule spirit doeth sometime speake the trueth, not as desirous to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the trueth, but to colour a lye with a fayre shewe of trueth; he is not, no not then, when hee speaketh that which is true, simplie to be heard, but rather to haue his mouth stopped, as our Sauiour Christ dealt with him in the first Chap. of Marke, and the 24. v. and <hi>Paul</hi> likewise in the 16. Chapter of the Actes, and the 18. verse. Neither ought we at any time more carefully to stoppe our eares against the voice of that charmer, then when he <hi>transformeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light,</hi> 2. Corinth. Chapter 11. verse 14. Neuerthelesse goe to, let vs learne this lesson of him,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:32"/> against him selfe, which the trueth wrung from him: and let vs be ashamed to be ignorant of that, which the Doctor of ignorance him selfe was constrained to acknowledge: namely, that our selues, our life, and whatsoeuer good thing we haue alreadie, or hope for hereafter, dependerh altogether vpon the power and goodnesse of God. VVhich being so, what greater or more certen madnesse can there be, then to dreame with the worlde and worldlings, that either that which wee haue may be kept, or that which wee haue not, and yet desire to haue, may be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by euill and vnlawfull meanes? And yet who amongest a thousande liueth otherwise? Nowe if this heauenly fence and fortification doe not properly belong to one man, but is common to all the godlie, the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of whome maketh the Church, of which the Lorde witnesseth, that <hi>He vvill be a vvall of fire rounde about her,</hi> as it is in the 2. Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi> and verse 5. and in the 66. Chapter, and verse 12. of the Prophet <hi>Esay;</hi> and hath not onely promised to garde her with an armie of Angels, <hi>Psalme</hi> 34.7. but also hath shewed it sensibly to the eyes, 2. <hi>Kinges,</hi> Chapter 6. verse 17. howe shall we say it commeth to passe, that so fewe flie into the bosome of the Church, and of those, who would seeme here to seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, so many are in bodie conuersant in the Church, but haue their mindes occupied in the middest of rhe worlde? what can we say else, but that they are giuen vp to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate sense? in so much that they beleeue not their owne conscience witnessing to them that none are in safetie but such as God protecteth, and that God protecteth not those, who giue their mindes to false and wicked dealing, yea here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they credite not <hi>Satan</hi> him selfe, to whose will they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise wholly addicted. They will not heare him in this place speaking the trueth, but they will heare him vainely and falsely boasting thus, <hi>All these thinges vvill I giue thee, if thou vvilt fall dovvne and vvorshippe me,</hi> Matthewe chap. 4. verse 9. But goe to, let vs returne these vvordes of Satan vpon him selfe. Thou acknovvledgest Satan, that all they vvhich feare GOD, are by God him selfe fortified on all sides with a most safe and inexpugnable bulvvarke.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:33"/> What then gettest thou by thy continual assaulting it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou doest nothing else but more and more worke thine owne most assured destruction: but the Church which thou wouldest so faine destroy, thou rather buildest, as which, the more egerly thou assaylest it, the more couragiously resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth thee: finally, against thy will thou helpest to cleanse it from filth and vncleannesse, which thou sweepest out of Gods house, so often as he giueth thee leaue to breake the hedge and to enter. <hi>For there must be heresies, that they which are approoved may be knowen,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. verse 19. And againe, <hi>Those which goe out from the Saintes, being drawen foorth by thee, were not of the Saints,</hi> 1. Iohn 2.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou hast blessed the worke of his handes, and his substance is increased in the lande.)</hi> What meane ye therefore all ye co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, guilefull, and desirous of gaine? If no other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect can move you, yet at the least giue credite vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which giueth you warning before hande. For if God doe blesse those men, which are of a holy and vertuous life (whereof you shall heare an ample and large discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in the 29. and 31. Chapters) it must needes be, that the wrath of God doeth most certainely hang ouer your heades, and that they which sowe iniquitie can reape naught else but destruction, as is shewed in the 4. Chapter, verse 8. &amp; Proverbs 22.8. But is he, whosoeuer he be who followeth <hi>Iobs</hi> godlinesse and integritie, so blessed as was <hi>Job?</hi> surely no: For beholde, that I may passe ouer many others, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn had neither golde nor siluer,</hi> Actes 3. verse 6. and <hi>Paul</hi> by liuing on the worke of his handes, learned by his owne experience what it was to stande in neede, 2. Cor. 11.8. and when as the rich glutton had all things at will, poore Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus full of sores was fayne to begge, finding more curtesie in the dogs tongues, then in the rich mans hands, Luke 16.19. yea in this our <hi>Iob,</hi> we haue a notable example both of a most poore, and of a most rich man togither. What therfore, hath not godlinesse the promises both of this and the other life? 1. Timot. 4.8. Truely it hath. But we must here especially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue two things: one is, that the proper and peculiar felicity of the godly, forasmuch as it is euerlasting and vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is not of any necessitie placed either in this life, or any
<pb facs="tcp:1955:33"/> goods which haue fellowship &amp; partaking therewith: which both the thing it selfe requireth, and holy Scripture teacheth euery where. The other thing is, that riches and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this life, albeit in this respect that they were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of God, they be good, notwithstanding forasmuch as they be esteemed and reckoned of, by the vsage, they are things indifferent, that is, to them that vse them wel, good, but to them that vse them not aright, euill and naught. And seeing that men of their owne nature be prone, and are as it were, caryed headlong into euill, how hard a thing it is in great abundance to keepe measure, euen to those them selues that are led by the spirit of God, we are sufficiently taught by the example of <hi>Solomon</hi> him selfe, the wisest of all men that euer were. Hereupon it followeth, that God doeth best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for those which be his, when he giueth them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this life sparinglie (for nature is content with a litle, neither doeth any mans life stande vpon superfluous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15.) and on the contrarie side, that he neuer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the couetous and wicked men more seuerelie, then when he giueth them somewhat more then they desire, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.7. The same is to be iudged of the contrarie, that is, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie &amp; other calamities of this life, which as things sprung vp by the sinne of man, do keepe their nature as often as they are inflicted vpon the wicked, that they may in the end be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away as it were from these suburbes of hell, to hell it selfe: but on the contrarie part, they do alter and chaunge their nature, so often as the Lord doeth by them, being vsed in measure without all extremitie, keepe vnder those which be his, when they begin to waxe wanton; or trie them, that they may be better knowen both to themselues and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or else vseth them as singular testimonies of his glorie vnder the crosse, when as the waight of eternall glorie doth infinitlie exceede all the afflictions which we suffer, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. But what meane those wordes, <hi>to blesse the worke of Iobs hands?</hi> Is it this, that <hi>Iob</hi> had begun to worke of him selfe, and that onely the issue of the worke was of God? not so. For it is God that giueth both the handes and all power to worke, in what things soeuer it be, to his children, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.17. yea and that of his speciall goodnesse: whereof we haue a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:1955:34"/> example in <hi>Beseleel, Exod.</hi> 31.3. But much more ought we to acknowledge this in those things which not onely are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural &amp; aboue nature, but also (if so be wee respect or looke into the corruption of our nature) against nature. Of this sort especially is regeneration by the spirit, wheras euery mans essence or beeing, commeth of his natural generation. Neither yet is the operation of that instrument, which God vseth, so abolished, but is distinguished from that work, which is wholly Gods owne, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. &amp; 9.1. In this order therefore is that to be vnderstood, which is here said, that God blessed the worke of <hi>Iobs</hi> hands. Out of which phrase or forme of speaking we also must learne this lesson, that although the hand of God be not to be tyed to those secondarie causes, which he hath appointed, as if we were to doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, when the secōd causes faile, or at the least wise are not seen of vs, albeit I say these things be so, yet he may worthily seem to despise the benefits of god, or to tēpt god, which neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth those meanes and instruments, which he hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appointed. Wilt thou therefore haue nourishment necessarie for this life to be giuen vnto thee? then labour and take paines according to the order of thy place and calling. For he that is ydle and worketh not, is vnworthie to eate, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.10. although the Lord preserued <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> fourtie daies without meat. VVilt thou in thy sicknesse haue thy health restored? vset hen the help of Phisicke if thou art able, onelie take heede of this, that after the example of <hi>Asa,</hi> thou put not thy whole trust in Phisitions, or altogither relie on them, 2. <hi>Cron.</hi> 16.12. Trulie <hi>Paul</hi> although he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and receiued the promise of God concerning him selfe and all that were with him, that they should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish by shipwracke, yet when the marriners thought to leaue the shippe and to prouide for their safetie, <hi>vnlesse saith he, these men remaine still in the shippe, ye can not be saued.</hi> VVilt thou obtaine euerlasting saluation? why then beleeue, but this faith or beleefe commeth by the hearing of the word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. Finallie to make an end, that which is here spoken of the <hi>worke of Jobs hands,</hi> is not so preciselie or strictly to be taken, as if <hi>Iob</hi> him self had put his hands to the plough or done some such like thing, which is of no likeliehood to be
<pb facs="tcp:1955:34"/> true, but according to the manner of the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> all trauell either of minde or bodie, or both, is tearmed by the name of handie worke. For he like a wise and godly housholder had in so wealthie and great a familie businesse ynough, wherein to exercise him selfe both day and night: and what those things were, wherein both night &amp; day he trauelled, himselfe as a sufficient witnesse will hereafter declare Chap. 29. &amp; 31.</p>

                  </q> Whereas Satan here asketh nothing which God doeth not afterward graūt vnto him, it is manifest that the wil of God &amp; Satā do here concurre &amp; meet together, but in as diuers a manner as light differeth from darknes. For that which Satan willeth and desireth, he doth it with a most wicked &amp; diuelish mind &amp; will, both against <hi>Iob</hi> whose destructiō he seeketh, &amp; against God, hoping that <hi>Iob</hi> by his prouocation woulde blaspheme his Creator. But that which God decreed from eternitie and now wil put in execution, it pertaineth partly to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being especially glorified in the constancie of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, partly it maketh to the good of <hi>Iob,</hi> forasmuch as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation bringeth forth patience, patiēce experience, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. &amp; last of all it laieth forth to the view of the whole Church, a notable paterne of patience, &amp; an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py issue of a most grieuous tēptation, whereby the church of God may be instructed euen to the end of the world, as <hi>Iam.</hi> teacheth, cap. 4.10. God therfore is not the author of sinne, although he be said not simplie to suffer or permit, but euē of his own wil &amp; purpose to worke by an euil instrument, which vnles we acknowledge, where shall we lay the foūdatiō of our comfort in tribulation? &amp; how shall that saying of <hi>Peter</hi> stād, that the <hi>wil of God is so, that we should suffer for well doing,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. But this certenly is true, that the euil wil of an euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument cōmeth not of God, but proceedeth wholly frō the voluntarie motion of the wicked, which notwithstāding God directeth to his right end, fetching light euē out of darknes, as it appeareth by Satans wordes. For God putteth not these things in his mind, but he is his own prompter, through that old cankred malice which is in him: and yet in this case one &amp; the same māner of dealing is not always seene. For in this place where it is handled of afflicting the godly, Satan first moveth the matter, and doeth as it were enforce God.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:35"/> But in another place, where question is of punishing the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as namely in the 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.29. the Lord him selfe spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth first, <hi>Who,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall entise Ahab that he may go &amp; fall at Ramoth Gilead?</hi> so that it can not be denied, but that euill wils also, are rightly &amp; iustly set on by God to do this or that thing, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> expresly teacheth in many places, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in his 3. booke against <hi>Iulian,</hi> cap. 5. But why did not Satan rather say, send forth me, then <hi>stretch foorth thine hand?</hi> Verely because he was enforced to confesse that not onely he can not do any thing, except god giue him leaue, but that also all his practises &amp; endevours will altogether be vaine &amp; to no purpose, except God do make them forcible and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: whereupon it came to passe that in that vision, whereof I spake a litle before, the Lord said, <hi>Thou shalt entise him, and shalt also preuaile.</hi> But what doth he call the hand of the Lord when he saith, <hi>stretch forth thine hand?</hi> truly, he meaneth him selfe. Is therfore the hand of Satan the hand of God? yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, but not as it being euill mooveth it selfe euilly, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth so many hainous factes against <hi>Iob</hi> and his familie, but as God vseth it well, sinning and offending as it doeth, that he might triumph in the patience of his seruant.

               <p>
                  <hi>And touch all that he hath)</hi> From whence commeth this so great and earnest desire of doing mischiefe? truely first and especially from that great and intollerable maliciousnesse of that most vncleane and cruell spirit, who, if it were possible, and if he were not by God held in hard as it were with bitte &amp; bridle, would not spare any creature. Secondly from that, that Satan hauing tryed the strength and courage of <hi>Iob</hi> a thousand times before in other temptations, despaired now of getting the victorie ouer him by any losse or greevance, vnlesse he were vvounded by such a blovve, as should leaue him nothing in his familie: which that he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not lightly or without a cause, this one thing sheweth euidently, that neither by this way could <hi>Iob</hi> be vanquished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vnlesse he blesse thee to thy face.)</hi> That is, curse thee, by an <hi>Antiphrasis,</hi> that is to say, a figure declaring the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary, as I shevved aboue in this chap. vers. 5. but there is
<pb facs="tcp:1955:35"/> to be vnderstood in such phrases as this is, according to the vse of the <hi>Hebrue</hi> tongue, an imprecation, sometimes expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as <hi>so and so the Lorde doe vnto me:</hi> and sometimes for comlines of speach sake, pretermitted. But in this place Satā could wish vnto himselfe no strange or nevve curse, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together by him selfe in all respectes execrable. But aboue all the rest vve are here to enquire vvhat that is, that Satan dareth so presumptuously &amp; confidently promise to him self concerning <hi>Iob.</hi> Surely a sinne too too grievous, and so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that the <hi>Hebrues</hi> do oftentimes not vvithout cause, by a comely and honest kinde of speaking, tearme it by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary name of blessing, vvhich of the Grecians is called blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie in a generall signification, for all railing and libertie of speach, vvhereby the credite of another man is empayred, in vvhich sense it is taken, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31. But of Diuines this vvord is taken peculiarly for those speeches or sayings against God him selfe, in vvhich, either that is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto God, vvhich is not agreeable vnto him, or that detracted, vvhich belongeth vnto him: neither of vvhich two can be done vvithout horrible sinne, no not by the vvay of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. For although it is one thing to blaspheme, another to speake blasphemie, as it is one thing to lye, another to tel or speake a lye; yet notvvithstanding <hi>Paul</hi> doubted not to confesse him selfe a blasphemer, for that he had ignorantly in the time of his blindnesse spoken euill of Christ, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. But this horrible monster springeth sometimes of pride, the vvhich kinde of blasphemy vvas that of <hi>Pharao,</hi> Exod. 5.2. &amp; <hi>Rabsakes,</hi> 2. Chro. 11.16. sometimes of anger, vvhich so setteth a man on fire, that he neither regardeth him selfe, nor him of vvhome he is hurt, especially if he knowe not hovve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; but riseth vp &amp; rageth against God him selfe: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it commeth of desperation, vvhich is a iust revvard &amp; recompence to many, for grieving the holie Spirit of God: sometimes also of an vncontrolled custome in svvearing; all vvhich circumstances encrease or diminish the vveight of this sinne. And all these occasions Satan thought him selfe to haue in a readinesse against <hi>Iob.</hi> For pride commonly is the companion of riches. But hovve many iniuries, and how grievous aboue measure they vvere that vexed and gauled

                  <hi>Job,</hi> is apparant by those things especially which himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearseth in the 3. Chap. And besides those vnspeakeable sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and troubles both of minde and bodie, comming one vpon the necke of another in so great a change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thinges, what did not <hi>Iobs</hi> foolish comforters buz daily in his eares, that might bring him either to madnesse or desperation? But this was a great helpe to <hi>Job,</hi> that he had so liued, and ordered his housholde, that all kinde of blasphemie was straunge to that familie, yea, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as yet, not so much as euer heard of. But in a worde, by howe many the more, and by howe much the fitter instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Satan vsed, to throw <hi>Iob</hi> heade long into this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible downefall, and gaping goulfe of destruction, so much the more excellent is <hi>Iobs</hi> victory, which he atchieved by the helpe of Gods spirite; albeit somewhat he seemed nowe and then a litle to stagger: and so much the more famous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we haue of the mercie and goodnesse of God, who neuer forsaketh those that are his faithfull seruants.</p>

                     <hi>Then the Lorde said vnto Satan, loe, all that he hath is in thine hand, &amp;c.</hi>]</q> Therefore none of <hi>Iobs</hi> goods were in the power of Satā, before this graunt which the Lord made him: which thing is so certainely true in the rest of the Saintes of God, that euen all the haires of their heades be numbred, as our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs in the Gospell of Luke 12. verse 7. Yea he may not doe what him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, not so much as against the wicked ones them selues, whose Prince notwithstanding he is said to be, he may not I say, worke his pleasure or will as to him shall seeme best, on them, no not although he be sayde to leade them captiues at his owne will, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> Chap. v. 26. <hi>For God suffereth vvith long patience the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction, Romanes</hi> Chapter 9.12. But shall we say that God would pleasure or gratifie Satan, when he made this graunt vnto him? No, god forbid. For what could be more vniust, then to deliuer vp his trustie and faithfull seruant into the hands of his deadly enemie to be tormented of him? therefore God permitting this to Satan, to speake properly, he gaue him nothing, but rather made him an instrument of his owne shame and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, when he gaue him vp to be vanquished and ouercome
<pb facs="tcp:1955:36"/> by <hi>Iob:</hi> but vnto his seruant he euen then prepared a notable, &amp; a victorious triumphe. Finally we must here learne and knowe this one thing, that although God doe speake vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, as it were giuing Satan power to determine what he would of <hi>Jobs</hi> goods, yet that Satan could neither deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine nor execute any thing, but that which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; all seconde causes together with their effectes, by a certaine hidden and secret operation, being obedient vnto the will of God and his decree, without any exception: which thing can not be denyed, but the speciall prouidence of God in euery particular thing must withall be denied, which without sinne and manifest impietie can not be done. For that there is a particular, yea and a most singular &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial prouidence, is apparant by that, that not so much as the successe of hunting is exempted from it, <hi>Gen.</hi> chap. 27. v. 27. nor the falling of sparrowes on the grounde, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10.29. yea not so much as a bough of a tree that is hewen, <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie</hi> 19. verse 15. And tell me I pray you, vnlesse the case stoode thus, what shoulde be done vnto vs, yea to the whole worlde euery moment, if it were absolutely subiect to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onely vpon him selfe shalt thou not stretch foorth thine hande]</hi> Here we see howe that God in trying and exercising those that be his, doeth alvvayes keepe a good measure. For he knoweth our strength beeing indeede the authour of it him selfe, aboue the which he will neuer suffer vs to bee tempted. Therefore albeit he had decreed to deliuer vp <hi>Iob</hi> into the handes of Satan, his life onely excepted, yet he graunted him as it were a truce to prepare and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him selfe, that beeing conquerour in the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, he might come the readier, and become the more willing to sustaine the seconde conflict. So in times past when he woulde frame his Apostles in Ierusalem by little and litle to suffer euery extremitie, he did in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning so farre keepe vnder the rage of his aduersaries, that they durst doe nothing at all against the Apostles, Actes Chap. 2. verse 43. afterwards he licensed them to draw them into prison, but on this condition, that beyond threats, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages they assayed nothing, <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.18. being thus confirmed,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:37"/> he layed them open to scourgings, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.40. till at the length the matter came to slaughter, first in the stoning of <hi>Steuen,</hi> aftervvarde in the murthering of <hi>Iames.</hi> But hovv fevv are there novv a days, vvhich being touched but vvith one of the least calamities vvhich befel <hi>Iob,</hi> both suddenly, &amp; all as it were at one clap, how few I say be they, which will not strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way crie out? O heauen, O earth, I am vndone, I am at my wits ende, what shall I doe miserable wretch, whither shall I turne my selfe? The onely cause hereof is this, that some there are, whose bellie is their god: some likewise, who are not masters of their owne goods, but their riches are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ouer them. But let vs contrariwise learne, God him selfe being the author of this lesson, not onely to distinguish, but also to seuer our selues from these thinges which we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, as often as it shall seeme good to the will of God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs thinke our selues to be vndone, if these be taken from vs, yea and that all at one time, considering that they are things altogether vaine and transitorie. And what mind we ought to be of, when we are brought to this passe, let it not grieue vs to learne of holy <hi>Job</hi> hereafter in the 21. verse of this Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>So Satan departed from the presence of the Lorde]</hi> That is, he immediatly betooke him selfe to that way, that by what means soeuer he could possibly, he might set vpon <hi>Iob;</hi> which diligence in euil doing, howe happie were it if we could imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in doing well? but beholde, whilest Christes enemies watch, and in the night set them selues in readinesse to take him, his chiefe disciples doe not onely snort and sleepe, but can not so much as be awaked in the garden. But we are to learne here that this departing of <hi>Satan</hi> out of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is so called figuratiuely according to the affection of man, when as nothing can be out of his sight, or be absent from him, which is euery where, and whose eyes watch both ouer the righteous, and ouer the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. vers. 16, 17.</p>

                     <hi>And on a day when his sonnes &amp; his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house,]</hi>
                  </q> Now here it is declared vnto vs, what manner of one Satan shewed him selfe to be, hauing receiued power ouer all <hi>Iobs</hi> goods and possessions: wherein we are first to obserue this,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:37"/> that it was not Satans purpose or intent herein to obey the will of God, but that he was set on with a desire only to hurt, or rather to destroy <hi>Iob.</hi> Whereby it is manifest that there is a great difference betweene the seruice of blessed spirits, as also of those men which are godly indeede, by which they obey the commaundements of God from their hearte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they loue him, and are delighted with his iustice reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto them, (of which iustice, his will is a perfite and all sufficient rule) I say there is a great difference betweene the seruice of these holy ones, and this counterfeit obedience of the deuils, which ariseth altogether from an envious hate of all good men, and an vnsatiable desire and greedinesse to doe hurt and mischiefe. For euery action is to be measured, not by the euent, but by the purpose and entent of the doer, as it is also rightly taught in the schooles of the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Let it be lawfull therefore for vs to vse this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that some are called the seruants of God actiuely, and therefore faithful, and liked of God, who commandeth them their seruice, whose workes also he rewardeth with a crowne of glorie: some are so called, onely passiuely, because God vseth as it were their hand and ministerie, as of the others of whome I spake euen now, in so much that nothing at all is exempted from the rule and power of God, which he hath ouer all and euery singular thing: but they doe that which they doe in such manner and order, that they thinke of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse then of God, but altogether serue and obey their owne lustes. And in this sense the Lord vouchsafeth to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> the name of his seruant, and he rewardeth the kingdome of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> as hauing executed the worke commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it in charge, <hi>Jerem</hi> 27.6. whom notwithstanding he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth afterwarde, and that very worthily. Hence we are to learne that double consideration of the will of God, of the which we will speake more at large in the 21. verse of this Chapter. For sometimes in a most large and ample signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by the name of will, we vnderstande whatsoeuer God decreeth: in the which sense is necessarily to be vnderstoode without any exception at all, whatsoeuer at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore hath bene done in the world, or nowe is done, or shall hereafter be done, seeing that nothing can be done against
<pb facs="tcp:1955:38"/> gods will, or besides his knowledge, without either attributing imbecillitie vnto him, or cleane taking away his prouidence. And yet for all this God is not to be deemed the authour of euill by any meanes, who alwayes both rightly and iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth and doeth euery thing, yea euen then when he vseth those instruments which mooue them selues to euill purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. In another signfication the will of God is or may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode in a more strict manner, as he is sayde to will that which by it selfe is good, and agreeable to the nature of God him selfe, and therefore is commaunded of him: and likewise to nill that which is euill in it selfe, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature of GOD him selfe, and therefore by him forbidden: in which sense the Lawe of God is the summe of this diuine will. But in which of these two significations so euer you take the will of God, whither in that which is more large and generall, or this which is more narrowe and particular; that saying of the Prophet standeth fast, <hi>Psalme</hi> 5. <hi>verse</hi> 5. (which is euen by the very testimonie of <hi>Plato</hi> confirmed also and established) <hi>Thou art not a God vvhich louest vvickednesse.</hi> But that also is most true, as is manifest by this example of <hi>Job,</hi> that God decreeth euen those thinges which are euill of their owne nature, and wherewith he is offended, but not as they are euill, but as it is good and expedient that there should be euill, by the vvhich he doeth at the length both iustly punish the wicked, and correct or trye the godly. But let vs returne to our purpose. I say therefore that the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of those most impure and vncleane spirites is heere set foorth vnto vs in liuely and orient colours, that is to say, their vnmeasurable greedie desire to destroy men, which leaueth nothing vnassayed, and woulde, vnlesse it vvere kept vnder, and refrained mightilie by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of GOD, destroy the whole worlde by a wonderfull sleight they haue in the knowledge of mischiefe, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable industrie in committing those thinges which be euill, so that Satan is not without his desert compared to an hungerstarued lyon, alwayes seeking whome he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, as we read in the 1. Epist. of the Apostle <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> the fifth Chapter, and the eight verse. Therefore he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb facs="tcp:1955:38"/> not so much as any one parcell of <hi>Jobs</hi> goods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, yea rather he scattereth and spoyleth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is his, except those which he vsed as fittest instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to assayle <hi>Iob,</hi> as first his wife, then a fewe seruants, which were the messengers of all his wofull tydinges, besides a fewe of his houshoulde, of whome he was moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as you shall heare him selfe hereafter complaine greeuouslie: and finallie his friendes which were indeede his greatest foes, as who by their venemous speaches gavvled him euen to the very heart. Here also we may note his subtiltie in obseruing and watching his fittest time, which was the day appointed to mirth and feasting, that <hi>Iob</hi> might be strooken so much the more suddenly, and that not all at one blowe, but successiuely, one mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe following after another, that the holy man might as it were dye so manie sundrie deathes, as there were diuers rroubles and crosses. Besides all this, that <hi>Iob</hi> might perswade him selfe, that all these thinges happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not vnto him after the common condition of all flesh: but that he was a man as it vvere singled out of God, to bee thus tormented by him as by a most deadly enemie, that through the extremitie of his griefe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of his soule, he might fall headlong into despaire and open blasphemie. Satan vseth no light kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, onely by sending robbers to carrie away his cattell: but he goeth more roundly to worke, and shaketh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth it selfe. To conclude, he differreth that bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bereauing him of his children to the last place, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue founde him most vnable to suffer that blovve aboue the rest, being before wounded with so many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and losses. Therefore we may not marvaile that <hi>Iob</hi> in these vexations, being grieued and exasperated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides with the most vniust and slaunderous allegations of his foolish friendes, could not alwayes keepe that absolute mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which he ought to haue done. But let vs rather wonder at this, and make vse of it to our selues, that he with such a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent streame of misfortune being caried as it were into the very entrance of desperation, yet stood fast vpon the trust of Gods power, who neuer forsaketh those that be his; and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:39"/> that he did at the length carry away so much the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent victorie &amp; conquest gotten ouer Satan &amp; him selfe by his inuincible constancie, by how much the more egerlie he was assaulted on euery side. All which things concerning this our deadly enemie, are to that end set before vs both here and in many other places of the Scripture, not that we should yeald our selues to the death, as beeing vnable to resist him, neither yet, that we should despise and make small account of him, as if he weare a weak and hartlesse enemie: but that, (knowing against whome we wrestle, not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual wickednesses which are in the hie places, and which are not amisse by the Apostle called the Princes which rule in the aire, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 22. &amp; 6.12. as it may in like manner out of this historie be obserued) we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue in a readines that spirituall armour of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to defend our selues against all the force and pollicie of such an enemie. And this we ought then most of all to doe, when he seemeth to offer vs truce, desiring God that he would endue vs with that heauenlie constancie, which may not suffer vs either to be puffed vp with prosperitie, or cast downe with aduersitie. Finallie let vs be ashamed hereof, that Satan is more diligent in doing mischiefe, daily labouring to bring vs to destruction, then we are carefull in the whole course of our life, to performe the dueties of our vocation, and to keepe our selues out of the daunger of so deadlie an enemie.</p>

The people of <hi>Arabia</hi> haue alwaies beene and are at this day infamous for violence and robberies, in so much that Satan might easilie prouoke and incite them to doe this outrage. VVhat meanes Satan vseth to drawe men vnto wickednesse, whether he doth it onelie by outward obiects, or by extraordinary visions and dreames in the night season, or else by some secret and hidden motion stirred vp in our mindes, I leaue to curious heades to be discussed. Surelie, not without good cause the Deuill is saide to haue entred into the hart of <hi>Judas,</hi> and there is great affinitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those spirits, and the spirituall nature of our minde. But seeing it is apparant and euident, how great the power of Satan is in leading and inforcing vs to all kinde of euill, by what meanes so euer he creepeth into our bosomes, and seduceth vs, it behoueth vs rather to laboure by all meanes to repulse and driue him from vs, then to busie our selues about so difficult and needelesse a question. Now whereas the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> tell vs, that this messenger and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whome mention is made afterwarde, weare diuels sent and suborned by Satan, it hath not so much as any sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of truth: and we may iustlie account it, amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

                  </q> Here Satan, the deadelie and professed enemie of mankinde, doeth more and more bewraie both his greedie desire to doe mischiefe, and also his subtile wilinesse and craftie slights which he vseth in hurting. For he neuer thinketh he hath done harme enough; his minde is neuer satisfied; he maketh one wounde after an other, wililie foreseeing this, that so couragious a champion could not be brought vnder with one stroke. VVho seeth not that Satan herein dealt very cunninglie, that he woundeth him not once for all, but giueth him one blowe after another, and that in such sorte, that <hi>Iob</hi> had no space to breath and recouer him selfe? Hence therefore let vs learne, that, although the Lorde (as the examples of all ages doe witnesse) doeth most commonlie so chastise his children, whome he neuer meaneth to caste off, that he doeth not laie many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon them at the first, or if he doe, it is to prepare them, beeing as yet nouesses, by light bickerings to beare out greater bruntes: and suffereth with long patience the reprobate and such as are by iust iudgement ordained to destruction, as the Apostle teacheth vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I say, wee may learne by this triall of <hi>Iob,</hi> that God doeth not alwaies deale in this manner. Let vs therefore arme our selues against the worst. But it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them especiallie to consider this, who in many conflicts haue alreadie got the vpper hand of Satan. For such a one was this excellent man <hi>Iob,</hi> who was then most egerlie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, when he had oftentimes put Satan to the worste, and had carried away diuerse conquestes and victories. Yet this still remaineth moste true, that GOD neuer suffereth vs to be tempted aboue our strength, and so to be vtterlie ouerthrowne. It is good for all Christians here to learne, as they are much vnlike to this vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in other things, so to be farre from all desire or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to doe harme; let them learne to bridle their
<pb facs="tcp:1955:40"/> anger although they haue iust cause to be angrie; let them learne to be gentle, meeke, mercifull, and, following the example of our moste bountifull Father, recompence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with good. Moreouer this place sheweth vs, that those soule and impure spirites are not without cause called of the Apostle, the princes of the ayre: neither was it for nothing that the Greekes and Latins were wont to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute many epithits vnto their <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the prince and chiefe of the Deuills, as to terme him, <hi>The gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer togither of the clowdes, the authour of thundring and lightning:</hi> and yet they are not able to moue any thing be it neuer so small, either in heauen or in earth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse God giue them leaue. But the Lorde, so often as it pleaseth him, doeth vse them as instrumentes to stirre vp such tempestes, and they, vntill such time as they be sente downe into the bottomlesse pitte, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuersant in the ayre and other partes of the worlde, and taking greate delighte in the confusion and disorder of all thinges, and especiallie in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and ouerthrowe of mankinde, beeing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise verie skilfull in all naturall causes, which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the effecting of these and such like things, doe with greate willingnesse and speede atchieue such enterprises, as GOD doeth either permitte, or commaunde them to take in hande: vsing also the meanes of witches and inchaunters of all sortes to bring their purpose to passe. Concerning which thing, seeing it appeareth so manifestlie as well by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foulde and moste vndoubted testimonies of the holie SCRIPTVRE, as also by the histories of all nations and in all ages, it may seeme marueilous and almoste incredible, that there should be founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among Christians, and especiallie Magistrates and Iudges, who are of opinion that these things are vaine and fayned. Neither are they lesse to be reprehended, who where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as GOD doth by violent motions and most fearefull sights in the ayre, warne vs of his iust wrath conceiued against vs, and those aduersarie spirits, hauing great power tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough GODS sufferance to mooue and trouble all
<pb facs="tcp:1955:41"/> these elements hang ouer our heades, doe thinke it a great point of courage and manhoode, not at all to feare thunder and lightning. Surely nature it selfe doeth refute them, and common sense, yea and the expresse authoritie of the holie Spirite, calling thunder not vvithout cause, the voice of God. Why Satan had this povver giuen him, not onely to shevve his cruelty in slaying the brute beastes, but also in destroying these men being <hi>Iobs</hi> seruants, vve vvil shevve (God vvilling) in the 18. verse.</p>

It is manifest that these Chaldeans were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and euen novve vvhen these things vvere done, (as it appeareth by this place) a base and obscure people, subiect to the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> vvhome at the length they ouercame and brought vnder their subiection.

               </q>
               <p>How and by what meanes Satan was able to raise this winde, namely, by Gods permission and sufferance, I haue shewed a little before in the 16. verse. This calamitie was by so much the more grieuous and doleful then the former, by how much children, are, especially to godly parēts, dearer then al other things whatsoeuer. Therefore Satan reserued this iniurie to the last, that with this he might break the hart of <hi>Job,</hi> and quite dispatch him, whom he had, as he thought before vtterlie discouraged. And moreouer Satan here omitted no circumstance at all in the atchieuing of this his cursed enterprise, which might any way make this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seem greater &amp; more grieuous. For it happened on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, euen then, when they thought of nothing lesse then of their destruction. Neither did this befall them by any such chaunce, as is common &amp; vsual amongst men, as if the house had bin ruinous &amp; therefore like to fall, but as if God with his owne hand had ouerthrowne it. And againe not one or two of his sonnes, but all were slayne with the fall of one and the same house: neither doth Satan spare his daughters, or any of his seruants, except onely one, who might carrie these heauie and dolefull tidings to his Master. Ought we not then at all times and in all places diligentlie to stande vpon our watch, and to be readie prepared against an enemy both so mightie and so subtill? But here by the way three waightie questions may be mooued; the first, whether <hi>Jobs</hi> children and seruants were to be accounted amongst those his goods, riches, and substance, which God put ouer into the hands and power of Satan. Secondlie if this weare so, it may be asked with what right and iustice, God, in this trial of <hi>Iob,</hi> seemeth to make no better account of so many men, then of bruit beastes, forasmuch as here, both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are slayne togither, without any difference. The
<pb facs="tcp:1955:42"/> third question is, what we are to thinke of the saluation of <hi>Iobs</hi> children and seruants, beeing so pitifullie destroyed: vnto all which questions, in order I make answere after this manner. First therefore I say, that Satan, although he be a most wicked cauiller and deprauer of the truth to beguile men, for which cause he was called <hi>Diabolus;</hi> yet did rightlie, and according to Gods meaning, vnderstand those wordes of his permission, <hi>Lo, all that he hath is in thine hande:</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God would neuer haue suffered him, to haue done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, though neuer so little, without he had giuen him licence and authoritie to doe it. Moreouer by the common law and custome of al nations, it is euident, that seruants and children haue beene esteemed as parts of the goods &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions of their masters and parents; so that masters haue had authoritie of life and death ouer there seruants: the beginning whereof, as should seeme, sprang from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of warre, in which it was lawfull either to kill those which were vanquished, or to spare their life vpon what condition soeuer it pleased the conquerour. Also fathers might sell their children, yea among the <hi>Romanes,</hi> three times one after another, as the lawes of their tenne tables doe testifie: whereupon the forme of setting children free had its beginning. And that caution which the Lord giueth <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.7. doeth shewe, that this was a vsuall thing among other nations also: in which place he doeth not abrogate that authoritie of parents in his people of the Iewes, but in the behoofe of the Hebrews children, which were so sould, he onely in some sorte restrayneth the too greate power of Masters ouer their seruants. And long after when this authority of masters ouer their seruants &amp; fathers ouer their children, had by diuerse laws beene very much lessened and brought to a kinde of moderation: <hi>Constantine</hi> a Christian Emperour, gaue libertie to parents, in the time of extreme famine, to sell their children, but yet so, that certeine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions should be agreed vpon, for the redeeming of them out of seruitude. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>God, de Patrib. qui lib. distraxerunt.</hi> Let this be graunted, will some man saie, yet this seemeth to be very hard dealing, and farre from that equitie and iustice which is in God, that he for the triall of one man,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:42"/> namelie <hi>Iob,</hi> should giue so many men into the hands of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan togither with herdes of beastes and cattell, to be slaine in so pittifull a manner, who otherwise are not charged with any faulte or offence by them committed: which thing surelie no man, vnlesse he were altogither sauadge and had cast of all humanitie, would euer haue done. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this obiection, let vs oppose these two most vnfallible groundes, the one, that the mightie power of God the Creator, whereby he alone doeth rule all things which he hath made, is not contained within any boundes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, the other, that this will of God, by the which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth determineth, and ordayneth all thinges after his owne pleasure, doeth not depende vpon any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side him selfe, and therefore is alwaies moste righteous and iust, forasmuch as this very power and will of his, is the rule and square of all things whatsoeuer, which are rightlie decreed and done. For it can not possiblie be, that any thing of it selfe and in its owne nature, shoulde be iust, before that God will haue it so (for then God should be ledde by the nature of things them selues to decree any thing or not to decree it) but contrariwise all the decrees and counsels of God are iust, because they please him. But men haue a rule prescribed vnto them by the worde of God, by the which they in their deliberations and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, are to iudge and discerne betweene iust and vniust: which if they follow, then are they saide to iudge and to doe iustlie, as also they are to be accounted vniust, if neuer so little either they exceede or come short thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that saying, <hi>Stat pro ratione voluntas,</hi> that is, <hi>my vvill and pleasure shall stande for reason,</hi> if it be attributed vnto men, is most wicked &amp; detestable, yet it is very religiouslie ascribed vnto God. The cause &amp; reason of the counsells, decrees, and actions of God is sometime manifest, as namely, when he doth chastice the sinnes of those whome he loueth for their good, or taketh vengeance of his enemies to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, sometime again it is hidden from vs, but it is neuer vniust, and because it passeth the capacitie euen of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells them selues, therefore it is alwaies to be reuerenced and adored, and neuer curiously to be searched into, least we
<pb facs="tcp:1955:43"/> be ouerwhelmed with the glorie and maiestie thereof. Let it therefore suffice vs to know thus much, that almightie God might rightlie and iustlie vse at his owne pleasure both the life of <hi>Jobs</hi> children, and also of his seruants, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satan by his owne crueltie, to declare his power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with his mercie in preseruing those whome he loueth, to leaue an example to the Church of most singular patiēce: and finallie to make knowne the glorie of his owne name in this so worthie a triumph and conquest ouer Satan. The same may be saide of all those continuall conflicts vnder the crosse, which although they were for the time most bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and cruell, yet they prooued in the end most glorious monuments of victorie, of which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writing in his first epistle and 3. Chapter, verse 17. saith not, that the Church was without a cause or against the will of God sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the furie of Satan &amp; earthly tyrants; but, <hi>Jt is better,</hi> saith he, <hi>(if the will of God be so) that ye suffer for well doeing then for euill doeing.</hi> Likewise in the 44. <hi>Psal.</hi> the Church of God greatly complaining of her miserable condition in this life, &amp; of the afflictions which shee suffereth, at the length brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth into these words, <hi>All this is come vpon vs, yet doe we not forget thee, neither deale we falsly cōcerning thy couenant.</hi> Now therefore concerning the saluation or destruction of these, whome Satan in this sort slue, not without the iust permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God; there is no cause why we should thinke, that God tooke thē out of the world in his wrath &amp; indignation, &amp; that they were as reprobates ordeined to eternal death. Charitie biddeth vs to cōceiue better of thē, &amp; to perswade our selues, that God herin dealt very mercifully &amp; louingly with them, especially with <hi>Iobs</hi> children, who had bin so holily &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously brought vp vnder such a father. God drowned the olde world for the infinite sinnes of the men of that age, 8. persons onely excepted, yet god forbid we should say or thinke that al they were condemned who perished with the waters. Farre also be it from vs to thinke, that those threescore &amp; 3. thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, who were slain by the hand of God for the offence which <hi>David</hi> committed in numbring the people, were al pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with euerlasting destruction: or, that, so often as the Lord doth reuenge the stubbornesse &amp; rebelliō of the world
<pb facs="tcp:1955:43"/> with the scourges of plague, pestilence, famine, or warres, all which die in this manner, doe vtterly perish; or else that god doeth in his wrath and furie (as impotent men are wont to doe) strike on euery side, and giue deadlie woundes to them that are next at hand.</p>

                     <hi>Then Iob arose, and rent his garment, and shaued his head, &amp; fell down vpon the ground, &amp; bowed him selfe.]</hi>
                  </q> We haue heard hetherto, both what power God gaue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ouer <hi>Iob,</hi> and what Satan by the helpe of his ministers hath done against <hi>Job.</hi> Now likewise let vs heare how <hi>Job</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued him selfe, and what a kinde of man he shewed him selfe, hauing receiued so many and so grieuous woundes. Go to then, let vs first seuerallie consider and weigh these things: and afterward see from what affection they did proceed. And first of al it is said that <hi>Iob arose,</hi> which word of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is vsed, for the taking in hand &amp; the addressing our selues to begin any new worke: but here it is opposed to that quietnes &amp; tranquilitie wherein <hi>Iob</hi> before was, whether he receiued those most sorowful tidings standing, or sitting at home in his house. As for the tearing of the garments, the shauing of the head &amp; falling on the ground, all these were vsuall signes of mourning in that countrie, which God did afterward mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his people, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.27. &amp; <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.1. Hereof also many things are spoken in the 22. chap. of <hi>Eccles.</hi> Now that which is added in the last place, to wit, that he <hi>bowed him selfe,</hi> doeth shew, that this his falling to the ground, did not proceede from any impatiencie, but contrariwise from a mind, which although it were full of sorrowes, reuerently and religiously submitted it selfe vnto the will of God, as <hi>Iobs</hi> owne wordes, which afterwarde he vseth, doe sufficiently prooue. For by that worde of falling vnto the grounde, which the Latins call <hi>Procidere,</hi> is meant not euerie inclination or bending of the bodie, but such as properlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth eyther to ciuill or religious worship. And thus much for the thinges them selues. Nowe let vs shewe that these gestures in <hi>Iob</hi> were not tokens of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciencie of minde, as some man may easilie gather, but of moderate greefe ioyned with a reuerent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious feare of GOD: and further let vs shewe that
<pb facs="tcp:1955:44"/> these dartes which Satan with all his power threwe against <hi>Job,</hi> were of this valiant champion not onely receiued with an invincible courage, vpon the impenetrable shield of faith, but also turned backe vpon Satan to his no small dammage. First therefore let vs call to minde, that <hi>Job</hi> did not arise at the first second or thirde message, but hauing heard the three first messengers with a quiet &amp; contented minde, at the fourth message he riseth vp, not as on altogether discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and amased, but as one raised by the hande of God, and warned, as it were by some inwarde and heauenlie motion, to shewe foorth and make knowen his godlinesse and patience: neither did he arise to this ende, that with a stout and stubburne gesture of the bodie, he might withstand God, as is the manner of them, who obstinately striue with God, and struggle to ridde them selues out of his handes; but contrariwise, that thereby he might with greater low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and humilitie, dispose and frame him selfe to the worshippe of God. Nowe, to gather into a briefe summe, and at once as it were to consider all those thinges which happened to <hi>Job,</hi> (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> doeth it verie notablie) who can but maruaile, that he which was spoyled of his goods, bereft of all his children, which were so many in number, and so deare vnto him, beeing rich in substaunce, but much more riche in children, so suddenlie loosing both the name of a Master, and the name of a Father, that he, I saye, in so iust a cause of sorrowe and lamentation, did not in any of these respectes, eyther offende against God, or against man, or against him selfe? Concerning which matter wee vvill speake more at large in the next verse. Great is the sorrowe which <hi>Job</hi> maketh; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he is so farre from sinning in this, that if he had bene nothing mooued at all, he had deserued most iust reprehension. For who knovveth not that most iust complaint, which the Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> maketh Chap. 5. verse 3. <hi>Thou strikest them, but they haue not sorrovved: thou hast consumed them, but they haue refused to receiue correction: they haue made their faces harder then a stone, &amp; haue refused to returne.</hi> VVhether therfore we be chastised for our sinne, or whether God doth lay his hand vpon vs for the triall of our
<pb facs="tcp:1955:44"/> faith, yea, if we be afflicted when we doe well, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. let vs obey that saying of <hi>Saint Peter</hi> in his 1. Epistle and fifth Chapter, vers. 6. <hi>Humble your selues vnder the mightie hande of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi> The same counsell <hi>Iames</hi> also giueth vs chap. 5. vers. 11. setting before vs this verie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iob.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Stoickes,</hi> condemning all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in that <hi>their wise man,</hi> who, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in one place verie well saith, <hi>as yet was neuer founde:</hi> haue done great iniurie not onely to nature, but also to God the authour thereof. And <hi>Gregorie</hi> writing vpon this place very truely affirmeth, that <hi>Iob</hi> in mournining and taking these thinges heauilie, was so farre from doing amisse, that he did all this according to the prescript of Gods Lawe, both in respect of the first and of the second Table, declaring both his loue towardes God, in that he rested vpon his will, and his fatherly affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his children, togither with a godly and louing care, which as a master he had ouer his seruants. Therefore the doctrine of the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ripatetickes</hi> is much more true, who teach, that affections are ingraffed in vs by nature, without which men shoulde become stockes and stones; so that they will not haue affections quite taken away, but onely brought vnto a mediocritie. And these men also haue left vs manie excellent preceptes, howe to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne our affections, and yet so, as that all humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is herein also diuers wayes vnperfite. For neyther haue they sufficientlie knowen the chiefe naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, neither yet rightlie made a difference betweene those which are naturallie settled in vs, and those, which the corruption of nature hath brought in, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the fountaine and originall of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and much lesse knowing what remedie to vse against these vices, and by what meanes nature may bee resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its former perfection and integritie. For onely the worde of God teacheth, and the Spirite of GOD wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth these thinges in their heartes, who are no more vnder <hi>Sinne, but vnder grace, Rom.</hi> Chap. 6. vers. 14. <hi>Galat.</hi> cap. 5.18. Nowe the examples of holie men, which are left vnto vs, that we may followe them, in <hi>Iacob, Joseph, Dauid, Ieremie,</hi> and manie others, doe shew, that natural affections,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:45"/> especiallie those affections of loue, mercie, and such like, are not simplie euill, but onely so farre as they sauour of the contagion of the flesh. Hither we must referre that saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.29. <hi>Which of you is offended, and I burne not?</hi> And surely we must needes make Christ him selfe a sinner, (which God forbid any man should thinke) if, to be touched with an inward feeling of compassion, and to weepe ouer the dead, are to be accounted vices and diseases of the minde; a doctrine more fit for Stoickes then for Christians. What the custome and manner was of the auncient Church, when as yet it was more pure, in solemnizing the funerals of the Saintes and in mourning for the dead, it may appeare out of their owne writings. Concerning which thing, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath written at large, and that very notably, though in some pointes not purely ynough, in his <hi>Homilies</hi> vpon <hi>John</hi> 84. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 6. Also in his 42. Homilie vpon the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Iob (saith he) wept in deede, but no more then a father louing his children, and hauing a care of thē being dead, should do. But we must not followe this auncient father in making prayers for the dead, which thing is not onely not confirmed by the worde of God, or by the pure Primitiue Church, but is also suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted by the authoritie of the fathers them selues, deliuering those things, to which no credence is to be giuen, and which fall to the grounde of their owne accorde. But hereof we shall haue occasion to speake more, when we come to the third Chapter of this booke.</p>

                  </q> Now in these wordes we may see, whence proceeded, and to what ende tended that tearing of his garments, shauing of his head, and casting downe of him selfe vpon the ground, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not of impatiencie, and much lesse of despaire (as <hi>Homer</hi> describeth <hi>Achilles</hi> at the death of his friend <hi>Patroclus</hi> vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe without al measure) but of a most grievous fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the hand of God vpon him; yet with such moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and patiencie, that, notwithstanding the bewailing his so great and so sudden losses, he doeth not onely comfort him
<pb facs="tcp:1955:45"/> selfe with the hope of a better life, as afterward he plainlie sheweth euen in the verie height and extremitie of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, but also he breaketh foorth into thankesgiuing: so farre was he from accusing God of crueltie and vniust dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as Satan his aduersarie hoped would come to passe. All which heauenly and wonderfull vertues are particularlie, and by them selues to be weighed and considered of. For this speach of his standeth in fewe wordes, but those verie pithie and significant; albeit it is likely that <hi>Iobs</hi> speach was by him, who wrote this history, rather thus comprised in a short summe, then set downe worde for worde, as by <hi>Job</hi> it was vttered.</p>

                  <hi>And he said]</hi> He was not therefore so dismayed, (although he had receiued so many grieuous woundes, and sustained foure hard and bloodie assaultes) that he became as dumbe as a stone, like to that <hi>Nabal</hi> mentioned 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37. or as the Poets haue feigned of <hi>Niobe:</hi> neither yet was he turned into a mad dogge, as the said Poets haue fabulouslie written of <hi>Hecuba;</hi> but casting his bodie vpon the ground, and setting his minde vpon God, forgetting as it were his present mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that sudden change and alteration which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, being ful of the faith and hope of another life, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to vtter most godly and heauenly speaches. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, euen then he became a Preacher, and a <hi>Bishoppe in his owne house,</hi> setting foorth vnto all his housholde, Gods power vnseparably vnited with his iustice, although he was not able to see the reason thereof. This is the thing of all other, that Satan least looked for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naked came J out of my mothers wombe.]</hi> In this place first of all we must speake of nakednesse, of which we finde two sortes in the Scripture: one, outwarde or externall, which concerneth partly our bodie, and partly all other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this life. The other, inwarde, which betokeneth an absence or want of the true goods and graces of the minde. That Iob meaneth not here this latter, it is apparant by the whole course of this his speach, whereby we may gather, that he neuer was richer in the good giftes of the minde, namely, in faith, in the hope of eternall life, in a true zeale of Gods glorie, then when he was brought to extreeme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
<pb facs="tcp:1955:46"/> and want of all other externall thinges. Therefore let vs nowe consider of the former kinde of nakednesse, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.25. <hi>And they were both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</hi> And no marvel, forasmuch as, till such time as sinne entred into the worlde, there was nothing in any part of the workemanshippe of the worlde whereof we might be ashamed, especially in man, whose most excellent beautie and comelinesse, euen tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all his bodie and euery part thereof, from the toppe of his head vnto the sole of his foote, did commende the wisedome of his maker: neither was there as yet any such vntemperatenes of the elements, that they stood in neede of apparell to couer them selues withall. Therefore those men are in a great errour, who thinke that our first parents <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did not blush, not because there was nothing in their whole bodie, whereof they might be ashamed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they being nowe like vnto young borne babes, were, as they them selues speake, innocents, that is to say, did not much differ from beastes, not knowing or vnderstanding as yet, the difference betweene that which is comely and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and that which is filthie and dishonest: which opinion is directly contrarie to that sacred historie. Nowe although if <hi>Adam</hi> had not sinned, without doubt men shoulde haue bene borne naked as they be: yet <hi>Iob</hi> doeth not speake in this place of that nakednesse, but of the other which hath followed sinne, and which hath bene ioyned with those inconveniences, for the remedie whereof, vnles God, mans most mercifull Creator, had not many and sundrie wayes prouided, (who couered those our first parents with leather garmēts) mankind had long before this time vtterly perished. And truly prophane writers, not without iust cause, doe account this estate of nakednesse to be a great miserie; but yet with great blasphemie and horrible impietie. For they doe not distinguish this nakednesse (whereof some of them falsely thinke that nature, others that God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) from that former nakednesse, which they knewe not, and which was no miserie, but rather a great orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of man. Neither doe these vnthankefull wretches marke howe many wayes God, being mercifull euen in his
<pb facs="tcp:1955:46"/> iudgements, hath prouided for this miserie. Of which thing let vs heare <hi>Plinie</hi> speaking in the Preface of his seauenth booke of his naturall historie. <hi>Before all thinges</hi> (saith he) <hi>Nature, a stepmother to man, doeth couer him vvith the giftes and supplie of all other creatures; whereas to beastes, fishes, foules, trees, and such like, she hath giuen diuers couerings, and as it vvere clothinges of their owne: as namely, shelles, hydes, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, haire, feathers, scales, fleeces; and hath also defended trees from colde and heate vvith a barke, yea, and sometimes with a double barke: but man onely she sendeth into the worlde naked, and assoone as he is borne, casteth him vpon the bare grounde.</hi> Thus much saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> who peraduenture might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, though he did not knowe the beginning of this euill and the cause thereof; if that the verie ignorance of this thing were not a punishment iustly layde vpon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: but herein he may not be pardoned, that, although he doeth set nature in the place of God, yet whereas she, whome he will haue to be the maker of all thinges, coulde not either hate or envie that worke, which was not yet begunne, or be founde vnable in making any worke or creature; truely he ought to haue suspected and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that neither man, nor those things which were made for mans sake, did continue in that state, which they had in the beginning receiued of their maker. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whereas it is much better to haue our choise of so many remedies, which God hath of his free will giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs for the helping of our nakednesse, from among so many of his creatures, to whome hee hath giuen coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for the vse and benefitte of man, then to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned whether we will or no, to be content with one couering; surely this nakednesse of ours, although sinne were the cause thereof, doeth not make man more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then other creatures. Which thing the verie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures them selues, if they were able to speake, woulde most manifestly declare, and woulde convince these prophane and wicked men of great impietie. But that wee may returne to speeake of <hi>Job,</hi> this is the same kinde of nakednesse which is meant in this place:
<pb facs="tcp:1955:47"/> but notwithstanding, it must be taken in a more large signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For <hi>Job,</hi> when as he saith, <hi>Naked came I &amp;c.</hi> doeth not onely meane, <hi>vnapparelled and without garment came I out of my mothers wombe,</hi> but we must vnderstande by this worde <hi>(Naked)</hi> the losse and want of all those goods, which <hi>Iob</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing together with a good name and great reputation, was the chiefe man, and best esteemed in all that countrie. But let vs consider what all men (except a verie fewe) are wont to doe, when as they sustaine any small dammage, and so shall we the better perceiue, howe great this courage of <hi>Job</hi> and valour was. <hi>Naked</hi> (saith he) <hi>came I out of my mothers wombe:</hi> as though he shoulde say, I see that I am not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly of a very rich man, become altogether a begger, but indeede I see, that I am brought to some pouertie and want: yea, these things which haue so suddenly happened vnto me from heauen, and not by the hande of man, doe threaten the taking away euen of those fewe thinges, which I haue left. But put case it should so come to passe: trulie this is no strange thing vnto me, but then rather the Lorde my maker did worke a straunge thing vpon me, when as he did couer me being borne naked into this worlde, and did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde heape vpon me so many and so great blessings of this life. Nowe therefore since he, withdrawing these thinges from me, doeth call me to my first and olde estate wherein I was borne, why should I be grieued hereat, whatsoeuer cause hath mooued and prouoked him to doe it? Surely this is the condition of vs all, wherein we are borne: therefore it is good for me to be put in minde thereof, least that so great plentie &amp; abundance of all things, might make me to forget my mortalitie &amp; the life to come, which is much better then this. Thus speaketh <hi>Job,</hi> not expostulating the matter with God, nor desiring to be restored to his former felicitie, nor regarding the remnant of his life which was behinde; but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king those things which were past in good part, and making vse and profite of this sudden alteration and chaunge, yea, &amp; as it were drawing light out of darkenesse it selfe. Therefore very well saith one, that <hi>Iob</hi> forgoing his wealth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance without griefe, did sufficiently shevve that he did not possesse them with that loue, from the which the spirite of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:47"/> God euery where doeth dehorte vs in the holie Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naked shall J returne thither.]</hi> What shall he returne into his mothers wombe? No surelie: vnlesse peraduenture we say that <hi>Iob</hi> by the name of <hi>mother</hi> vnderstandeth the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is called of prophane writers, <hi>Magna mater,</hi> that is, <hi>Our great mother,</hi> in respect of our first creation, which was out of the earth. But it is better to vse this worde <hi>(thither)</hi> not as hauing respect to any worde before expressed, but to some other already sufficiently knowen: as <hi>Mercer</hi> well noteth the like manner of speach in that place of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> cap. 3. vers. 17. <hi>There the Lorde shall iudge all things. There,</hi> that is, <hi>in the last iudgement,</hi> or <hi>in the last age;</hi> neither of which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the wordes going before. So that here this worde <hi>(thither)</hi> signifieth as much as <hi>to the graue:</hi> according to that which the Lord speaketh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>vers.</hi> 19. <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou returne.</hi> Hereupon saith the Preacher, <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes</hi> 5.14. <hi>As he came forth of his mothers bellie, he shall returne naked, to goe as he came.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6. <hi>We brought nothing into the worlde, neither shall we carie any thing with vs out of the worlde.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Chrisostome</hi> doeth no lesse grauely then pleasantly deride and scoffe at that needelesse cost, which some men bestowe vpon the couerings of their dead bodies. Nowe although we say that <hi>Iob,</hi> speaking in this wise, had cast off all hope of being restored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer state and condition of life; yet there is no cause, why we should thinke, that this speach proceeded from a minde drowned in desperation. For euen common sense enforceth the godly also to thinke, whensoeuer any present calamitie befalleth them, that they can neuer possibly recouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and yet not absolutely and without all exception, but so farre as mans reason is able to discerne, and also so, as it nothing at all hinder the course, and hope of eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yea, howe often doe the very Saintes of God in their grieuous temptations, as it were knocke at the doores of desperation? yet when they are in that state they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forsaken, yea they want nothing as the <hi>Psalmes</hi> in very many places do witnesse, and especially that dolefull lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Ezechias.</hi> But I rather thinke, that <hi>Iob</hi> doeth heere shewe, not so much what he thought God had decreed of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:48"/> him, as that he him selfe was readie to beare patiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pouertie, euen to the death, if it so pleased the Lord: so farre was he from expostulating the matter with God, and asking the cause why he shoulde be thus bereft of all his goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lorde hath taken away.]</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this speach may haue a shewe of meere blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in that <hi>Job</hi> seemed not onely to attribute vnto God a certaine mutation and changeablenesse; but also to make him the authour of all those mischiefes, which were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both of Satan, and also of those theeuish nations, the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeans</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> therefore first we must prooue that this saying of <hi>Job,</hi> was not onely not wicked and blasphemous, but contrariwise, that it was both thought and vttered most godlily and religiously. Afterward I wil shew, what and how great vse we are to make of this excellent speach and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēce pronounced by <hi>Iob.</hi> Now therfore the state of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is not, whether God be the author of sinne, which thing I confesse can not be once thought, (euen as <hi>Plato</hi> an heathē philosopher doeth learnedly discourse) without most vile &amp; horrible blasphemie, but the question is, whether it may be truely said, &amp; whether we ought so to speake, that God both in respect of his will &amp; of his actions which are alwayes iust, doth beare any part, yea, and which is more, that he beareth the chiefe and principall part in willing and working al those things &amp; euery of them, which are committed most vniustly and wickedly in the world: which thing I doe not doubt, but that it is very agreeable to true religion, and that it greatly standeth with the glorie of God: other contrariwise do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it as a thing blasphemous and full of impietie. First therefore I will set downe certaine groundes, whereof no man can doubt, but he must needes be convicted not only by infinite testimonies of the word of God, but also by the true and common notions and principles, which are naturally settled in all mens mindes, concerning the knowledge of God, yea, and by the testimonie of his owne conscience. The groundes are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God, as he is the maker of all things which are, both in generall and in particular, without any exception, so
<pb facs="tcp:1955:48"/> he is the gouernour and ruler thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore, that nothing can be done, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can happen, either God being vnwilling and striuing against it (for then he shoulde not be almightie) or else not knowing of it, or not caring whether it bee done or no (for then he should not be a right and iust ruler of the worlde.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore, that not onely the euent of thinges, but euen all the second causes, are mooued, ruled and directed to their endes by God, not being ignorant or idle, much lesse constrained and against his will, but by God decreeing and willing to haue it so.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore, things all and euerie one, are done by the decree, will and working of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the vvill of the most iust and most vvise God, is not to be esteemed, either by the state and condition in vvhich his creatures are (for novve some of them are good, and some euill) neither by the qualitie of the causes vvhich he doeth vse, (for some of them do vvorke rightly and vvell; some yll and naughtilie; some neither vvell nor ill; some doe not vvorke, nor mooue them selues at all) but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivvise, thus vve must thinke of the vvill of God, that vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he vvilleth, mooueth or vvorketh, he vvilleth, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and vvorketh it alvvayes iustly: that is, all things both in vvhole and in parte, both vniuersallie and particularlie considered. He that denyeth these thinges, denyeth God. But you vvill say, by this meanes is taken away all difference betvveene good and euill in our thoughtes, sayings and actions; and so God him selfe (vvhich is great blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) is made the authour of all euill and vvickednesse. GOD forbid. But againe vve vvill refute the falsenesse of this consequence, by these most certaine axiomes and groundes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although God doeth no more stande in neede of any middle and seconde causes, to rule all those thinges vvhich hee hath made, and to direct them vnto their proper endes, then hee did vvant either matter or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentes, vvhen hee created all thinges of nothing, by the great and mightie povver of his vvorde: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb facs="tcp:1955:49"/> he hath made and ordeined causes, such and so many as he thought good; whose meanes he doeth vse, not of anie necessitie (as the <hi>Stoickes</hi> haue fondly dreamed) but most freely, to effect whatsoeuer he will, euen whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and howsoeuer it pleaseth him selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The instruments and meanes which God doeth vse, be threefolde. For some of them be altogether <hi>passiue,</hi> that is, of them selues they can not mooue them selues, nor doe any thing, vnlesse they be mooued either immediately of God, or else of some other secondarie causes; and of this kinde, be all creatures which are without life. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which are mooued outwardly, but so, that they them selues doe mooue also, by a certaine naturall appetite, being guided and directed by no vnderstanding or reason; and therefore they can not properly be said either to doe well or yll. Of this sorte are all bruite beastes, in which there are diuers degrees of motions, not needefull novve to bee spoken of. Other yet are so outwardly mooued, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endued with vnderstanding and reason, haue some parts of their owne in working, whereby they doe effect some worke, which may truely and properly be called their owne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All these last kinde of instruments, to witte, Angells and men, haue bene good, and euerie one of them were so made from the beginning. Neuerthelesse, this goodnesse in them was subiect to chaunge and alteration; forasmuch as God onely is absolutely and alwayes good, without any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or chaunge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereupon it came to passe, (and that not without the decree of God, alwayes doing iustly, vvho then did open the vvay to declare and sheevve foorth, both his iust seuerity, vvhich should ensue, and also his most bountifull mercie in Christ) hereupon, I say, it came to passe, that part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and all mankinde in Adam did fall, and that through their ovvne free vvill and inward motion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That fall did neither quite destroy the nature of the Angels, nor yet of mankinde, but did onely depraue and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it: yet so, that their whole will and inward motion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in that state wherein it is nowe, can not moove and applie it selfe to doe any thing but sinfully: and therefore it
<pb facs="tcp:1955:49"/> it can doe nothing, which may iustly be accounted good; but all whatsoeuer it doeth, is alway sinfull and wicked.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This euill in those wicked Angels, God hath not as yet taken away, nor yet euer will, as the holie scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs. But he hath, and doeth, and will more and more correct and amende it in those, whome, through his infinite mercie, he hath chosen out of all mankinde, and whome he hath predestinate to saluation in Christ and through Christ; who hauing their mindes enlightened, and their will effectuallie sanctified by the holy Ghost, as God worketh by them rightly, so doe they also well and rightly mooue them selues; in so much that both the worke of God moouing them, and the worke of them moouing them selues, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh but according to the spirite, is good and iust.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But that we may make a difference betweene the iust worke of God, wrought by those instruments which also mooue them selues, and that other worke or action, whether good or euill of the instruments them selues, in like manner moouing them selues: the auncient fathers haue taught vs to distinguish Gods <hi>Astion</hi> from his <hi>Permission:</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is as true and necessarie if it be rightly vnderstood and according to their meaning, as it is false and litle lesse then blasphemous, as it is abused of the <hi>Sophisters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. For they, who fearing least God should be made the authour of sinne, doe separate his permission from his will, by which all things, without exception, are that which they are: and who holde vs in hand, that those things which are wickedly done by euill and sinnefull instruments, are onely foreseene, and not decreed, they I say, do first of all very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely confound the workes of God, which are alwayes iust, what instruments soeuer he vse, with the worke of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, which doe not well and rightly mooue them selues. Againe they exempt the farre greatest part of the thinges which are done in this worlde, from the decree and ordinance of God, seeing they are infinitely more, which are done ill, then which are done well: and so they shut vp into a very narrowe roome that power of God, by which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and gouerneth all thinges, and vpon which not onely
<pb facs="tcp:1955:50"/> the euent and issue of euery thing, but euen the things them selues, togither with all their actions doe depend. Moreouer they depriue the godly, being afflicted by Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, of a most singular comfort, whereby we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded out of the Scriptures, that Satan and his ministers are not able to take in hande, much lesse to do any thing against vs, vnlesse the Lorde both be willing and haue decreed the same. Lastly, I say it is manifest impietie, to thinke that any thing, though neuer so small and contemptible, hath euer bene, or hereafter shall come to passe, which God (being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes most perfitly good and iust, who also is ignorant of nothing, who worketh all in all, and against whose will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done) hath not freely and of his owne will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed from all eternitie.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Therefore as touching God him selfe and his proper or peculiar worke, he alwayes iustly willeth, decreeth, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth whatsoeuer he doeth in this worlde, by whomsoeuer, whensoeuer, and howsoeuer he doe it: that is, whatsoeuer is done, or whatsoeuer commeth to passe in this worlde both in generall and in particular. Now in respect of the middle instruments which are also mooued of them selues, albeit alwayes he well and rightly mooue and vse them, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is he said to worke in good instruments, that is to say, which rightly mooue them selues, as namely in the good spirites, and in his regenerate: creating in them good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he afterwarde cherisheth and bringeth to good effect; so that the whole glorie of that good worke which is wrought by these liuely and moouing instruments, is to bee giuen to God as the principall cause and authour thereof. But as touching euill instruments, and such as doe not well and rightly mooue them selues, namely the deuils and all those who are not regenerate, yea, the very regenerate them selues so farre as the flesh sinneth in them; God is not said to worke in them, as who putteth not into them any inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and will to doe wickedly; but onely not restraining that corruption which naturally he findeth in them, he suffereth and giueth them leaue to mooue them selues and to doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their euill and noughtie disposition. And yet God alwayes vseth well and to good and iust purposes these euill
<pb facs="tcp:1955:50"/> and sinnefull instruments, either as a most iust Iudge setting the wicked together by the eares, to worke one anothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: or as a louing Father chastening his children euen by the hand of those wicked ones, and sometimes exercising them as he thinketh best, for his owne glorie and their profite.</p>
               <p>All which things to denie, were shamelesse and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible impudencie, such as is reprooued by the verie naturall knowledge of God, and conuinced almost by euery line in the bible, and diligently confuted by <hi>Augustine,</hi> and that of set purpose in diuers of his writings, but especially in his 3. booke against <hi>Julian,</hi> cap. 5. Now then, all this which hath bene spoken being vndoubtedly true, vve can not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vvhat vve are to iudge &amp; thinke concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Notwithstanding least any man finde fault, that all these groundes are taken from humane reason, and not from the vvorde of God, let him ansvvere me, vvhether God himselfe may not properly and vvithout blasphemie be said, to haue sent <hi>Joseph</hi> into Aegipt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. to haue raised vp <hi>Pharao,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vvhome hardening his ovvne heart, he might shevve his povver, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.21. to haue giuen <hi>Dauids</hi> vviues to his sonne <hi>Absolom,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12, 11. to haue mooued <hi>Dauids</hi> heart to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. to haue bidden <hi>Shimei</hi> to curse <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. So the Lord calleth the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> his sanctified, &amp; the instruments of his vvrath, <hi>Esay</hi> 10.5, and 13.6. And the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is compared to an <hi>axe,</hi> and to a <hi>sawe, Esay</hi> 10.15. In like manner the rebelling and falling avvay of the ten tribes from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his ovvne vvorke, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.4. So likevvise the godly are afflicted by the vvill and foreappointment of God. And that vve may not forget the most excellent vvorke of all others, namely, mans redemption, that most auncient, true, and Apostolicke Church, not vttering any blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but speaking as it vvas mooued by the holie Ghost, vvith one accorde cryeth out, that <hi>Herode and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles &amp; people of Israel gathered them selues together, to do vvhatsoeuer the hand &amp; counsell of God had determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done.</hi> By which testimonies, with infinit others, both that oppositiō &amp; cōtrariety betwene gods <hi>permission</hi> &amp; his <hi>wil,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1955:51"/> betweene his <hi>decree</hi> and his <hi>Action,</hi> is confuted: and also the workes of God which are alwayes most righteous and iust, are truely discerned from the euill workes of naughtie and sinnefull instruments. Nowe, that God punisheth sinne with sinne, and that as a most iust Iudge by his most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will and power (in which sense <hi>Augustine</hi> very well saith, that although euill is alwayes euill, yet it is good there should be euill, which God may afterward iustly punish and reuenge) that God, I say, punisheth one sinne with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is manifest, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.37. where God is said to giue wicked Kings for the sinnes of the people: and in the 34. Chap. of this booke vers. 30. to let the hipocrite raigne: to mingle the spirite of errour, <hi>Esay</hi> 19.14. to harden the heart, and to make it obstinate, to blinde the eyes, to make drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the wine of giddinesse, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.6.10.11.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Josu.</hi> 11.20. and 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. &amp; 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.7. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.15. In like manner God punisheth the contempt of his maiestie giuing men ouer into a reprobate sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. sending strong delusions that they should beleeue lyes, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.19. and also sending euill spirites with a charge to hurt, and an effectuall power to deceiue, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 22.22. &amp; 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.21. Finally, that we may at the length returne to <hi>Job,</hi> did God either as being vnwilling, or as one sitting still and doing nothing, thus answere Satan going about and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to doe wickednesse and mischiefe, <hi>Loe, all that he hath is in in thine hand?</hi> Doeth <hi>Job</hi> blaspheme, in that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth those thinges to God, which were wickedly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him by Satan, by the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Caldaeans?</hi> or doeth he rather, raising him selfe higher from these instruments vnto God him selfe, acknowledge that there was no power in them as of them selues to doe him any harme, and hereby also make a great difference betweene the worke of God, in which he altogether resteth contented, albeit he coulde not see any cause or reason thereof, and the action of Satan and his instruments? But of this matter there needeth no more to be spoken.</p>
               <p>Before we proceede to that which followeth, in this place we must dissolue one doubt, which is of no smal importance. <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) hath giuen and the Lord hath taken avvay.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1955:51"/> What therefore is God mutable, his minde beeing chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as it commonlie falleth out with men, whether for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or lighter causes towardes their most especial friendes? verily there is no change or alteration in Gods will, and therefore these and like speeches in the Scripture, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and spoken onely in resemblance of those affections which are in man. And although men both see and feele fearefull alterations, as well publique as priuate, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen through their owne fault, and because they abuse Gods patience and long suffering: yet we must not in any wise thinke that there is any chaunge and mutabilitie, though it be neuer so small, in the will or in the decrees of God▪ but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that what things soeuer are changed (and surely there is nothing vnder the heauen constant &amp; durable, as the wise man teacheth) are therefore changed, because God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueably and from all eternitie decreed that they should be chaunged, when and how it pleaseth him. Therefore so farre is it, that God by changing other thinges is him selfe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that quite contrary he might iustly be esteemed vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant &amp; mutable, vnlesse those things were indeede changed, whereof the eternal &amp; immutable decree of Goe is, that they should not alwayes continue in one &amp; the same state. Nowe therefore God only in him selfe &amp; of him selfe is simply and altogether vnchangeable: as for those blessed Angels which kept their first estate and left not their owne habitation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are immutable, yet they haue not this by nature, but by the gift &amp; blessing of God, being by his power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue continuallie preserued and vpholden, that they may not fall. In like manner that immutabilitie of the elect in the life to come, we must acknowledge that it is wholly from God, whome it pleaseth, to giue them the fruition of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, which through <hi>hope</hi> vvas onely begunne in them in this life. But this worlde vvith all thinges therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined is turned vp and dovvne, and chaunged almost eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry minute, as in <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> it is discoursed at large. But of those thinges vvhich are in this sorte subiect to alteration and chaunge, there is a manifolde difference. For some of them are so chaunged, that neuerthelesse they still rémaine whole and sounde: as namely, the heauens and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:52"/> which at the day of iudgement shall onely be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: concerning which matter we must notwithstanding iudge soberlie, and take heede that we rove not boyonde the boundes and precinctes of Gods worde. Other there are which vtterlie perish, and shall neuer be restored; such are all singular thinges of all kindes, which doe here as it were by course one after another rise and fall, growe vp and decay, as it pleaseth God to dispose of them, and shall at that day which God hath appointed, vtterly be abolished: I except man, whose soule as touching its substance, can not by death be dissolued: yet the good qualitie or disposition thereof is by originall sinne chaunged, corrupted and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: the bodie for a time death dissolueth, which shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either put on blessed immortalitie, or else remaine in hell torments for euer &amp; euer. That which I said of the world and all worldly things, is also to be vnderstood of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouernment, and of al other things, which belong only to this life. For howe and to what ende should these continue, the whole course and periods of the worlde, together with this earthly life, being fully complete and ended.</p>
               <p>But the spirituall and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> gouernment of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred fellowshippe and societie of the true worshippers of God, is not to be accounted in the number of these worldly thinges which I spake of, and which I said were not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant, but altogether vaine and transitorie. Neuertheles this also is subiect to marueilous alterations, though not of its owne nature, but by the hand and will of God, hereby ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proouing his children, as we are taught <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.18. or else by his iust iudgements chastising them. Hence therefore it commeth to passe, that those outward markes and tokens of this holy fellowship, although they be alwayes inherent in the nature of the true Church, are notwithstanding at some time chaunged, interrupted, and broken off, in so much that they can not be seene and perceiued of men, but are onely seene and discerned of God, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.6. Our Sauiour Christ foretolde that these things should come to passe in the latter dayes, into which we are fallen, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. Hereof also <hi>Paul</hi> forewarned vs, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3. &amp; <hi>John, Reuel.</hi> 12.14. yet it is most certen that so long as this world lasteth,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:52"/> they can neuer vtterly be abolished. For both experience &amp; reason do sufficiently prooue it. Although the Church hath bene in the waues continually tossed to &amp; fro, so that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it seemed to be quite ouerwhelmed, yet it hath risen vp and shall rise euen out of the middest of the waues, be they neuer so outragious: being raised as it were out of the bottome of hell it selfe, by the hand of a most mighty and mercifull Sauiour. Moreouer faith being defaced and quite taken away, it would necessarily come to passe, that there should be no Church, that is, no kingdome of Christ here vpon earth. Nowe faith commeth by hearing the worde preached, therefore so long as the worlde standeth, there shall be some preaching more or lesse of the sauing worde. But this preaching is sometimes publicke, and to be seene of all those which will but open their eyes: sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is rare and priuate, either thorowe the negligence, or thorowe the wickednesse of the Pastours, whereby it commeth to passe that the spirite of errour preuaileth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the trueth. Such a Church <hi>Samuel</hi> founde, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. and Christ him selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.36. But after that the number of the elect is fulfilled, and Christ shall come in glorie and triumph, then doubtlesse all that spirituall gouernment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained only for the gathering together of the Saints, shall cease: for the Sonne hauing brought all things vnder his subiection, shall deliuer vp the kingdome to the Father, as the Apostle most divinely teacheth, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. Nowe as touching these spirituall and supernaturall graces, of which the Apostle speaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. some of them are onely to last for a time, and some are perpetuall. And of this latter sort againe, some onely continued to the ende of this life, and others are to continue for euer in those who are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of them. Those which are onely to last for a season, are such as are common to some reprobates with the elect, as it is manifest by the example of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and that saying, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but fewe are chosen:</hi> yea and those truely are not alwayes effectually called, whose ministerie the Lord vseth for a time to call his elect to the knowledge of salvatiō. But all those graces which the Lord bestoweth vpō those for the benefit of others, shall finally be withdrawen from them,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:53"/> and they as reprobates and castavvayes shall eternally be condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. So the gift of prophesie vvas taken from <hi>Saul,</hi> so <hi>Judas</hi> the betrayer of Christ, like a vile vvretch lost verie many excellent graces; many also fall away from the faith, I meane not any true and liuely faith, but such a faith as lasteth onely for a time; and into these men, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vvhich went out of them, entreth with seuen worse then him selfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. So at this day the Church findeth no greater enemies, then those of whome the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Act.</hi> Chap. 20. vers. 29. Yea in the godly verie manie times, when as they greeue the holy Spirite, these giftes fayle, and for a time seeme as it were vtterly to be defaced and blotted out, as that most lamentable example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> shevveth in three most greeuous sinnes, adulterie, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betraying the armie of GOD. And therefore Christ doeth not without cause so often warne vs, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be watchfull: and the Apostle counselleth his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Timothie</hi> not to suffer the gift of God which was in him to perish, but rather to stirre vp the same. Finally, we may not be ignorant of this that many of those giftes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, as namely, the gift of tongues, the gift of healing, and the gift of foretelling thinges to come, beeing onely for a time bestovved vpon the Primitiue Church, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Apostles doctrine by miracles, by litle and little ceased, <hi>Matth.</hi> Chap. 16. vers. 20. And nowe what neede haue we of these seales, seeing the trueth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doctrine hath alreadie bene confirmed by so manie and sundrie miracles. But those spirituall giftes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and neuer cease, which God hath appointed as subordinate meanes and causes, for the executing of his eternall decree of saluation, in electing and calling those in time, whome he hath predestinate from euerlasting; for which cause of <hi>Paul</hi> they are sayde, <hi>to be vvithout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Rom.</hi> Chap. 11. vers. 29. and he reckeneth them vp shortlie, <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 8.30. Of this sorte therefore is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall vocation, which at that verie instant, when it seemeth best to the heauenly wisedome, begetteth in the elect faith, hope, and charitie, vpon which followeth iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith, and finally glorification. For these are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:1955:53"/> vnseparably vnited: and vnlesse we be certainely perswaded of this, wee shall neuer enioye any true peace of conscience. For otherwise it must of necessitie followe, either that God is chaungeable, with whose will it maye stande to haue him condemned, whome before he woulde haue saued, or else the condition of faith annexed to the promise of the Gospell, shall depend not vpon Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable decree, but vpon the will of man. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can not be saide without blasphemie; and this ium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth with the heresie of the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> And here I let passe infinite most plaine, and vndoubted testimonies in the writings of the Prophetes and Apostles, by which it may be prooued that the saluation of the Elect standeth sure and immutable. But two thinges are in this argument es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to be obserued. For this stedfastnesse and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie taketh place both in euerie one of the Elect, and in the Church, properlie so called, that is, in the whole companie of the elect and true beleeuers, and not in these or those particular Churches, nations, people, cities or families, not yet in the <hi>Church,</hi> being so generally or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally taken, as in it are conteyned not onely the elect and true beleeuers, but hypocrites also and castawayes. For thus we see, howe the people of the Iewes haue fallen away from the couenant of the Gospell and of saluation, it beeing nowe translated vnto the Gentiles: and that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> not without cause threatened the same iudgement vnto the Gentiles long agoe, at this day we may see suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe in that generall Apostacie or defection al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of the whole earth vnto the detestable religion of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and in that whoore of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath made drunken so many Kinges, and so manie thousandes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the cuppe of her abominations: and yet not one of the Elect and true beleeuers, whether he be <hi>Jevve</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> doeth, nor euer shall perishe. Secondly wee must knowe, that among those principall giftes of the Spirite, there are some, which in the faithfull, ende together with this life, and others, which are onely begunne in this life, and shall be made perfite in vs in the life to come. Of the first sorte are <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> not as though their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:1955:54"/> were flitting and vnconstant, but because (all those thinges being nowe finished and come to passe, which the Elect in this life partly as being already past, and partly as yet to come, beleeued and hoped for) there shall then no longer be any place for <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> But the <hi>knowlege of God,</hi> whereby, while we liue in this worlde, we knowe him onely in parte, shall be made perfite in the worlde to come, when as wee shall stande in Gods presence, and see him as it were face to face: and <hi>Charitie,</hi> by which we loue God and our brethren in this life very coldely, by reason of that fight which is betweene the flesh and the Spirite, shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wonderfull manner, such as no tongue is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, vnite and ioyne vs with God and his blessed Saintes, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. vers. 8, 9, &amp;c. and then shall that prayer of Christ take full effect, which he made euen then, when hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him selfe to vndertake the death for our sakes, and which is recorded, <hi>Ioh.</hi> Chap. 17. vers. 22.23. &amp;c. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this poynt let it suffice to haue spoken thus much, both▪ against the daungerous errours of those men, who not content, in steade of the Church beeing a pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, to present vs with a paynted harlot, and abusing that saying, that the Church can neuer perishe or bee abolished, woulde holde vs in hande, that that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyte vizarde of theirs, is, and alwayes shall be the true face of the <hi>Church,</hi> herein deceiving them selues and others: and also of them, who most falsely teach that the holie Spirite and also true faith may often times not onely for a time bee hidden and lye as it were smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but euen bee quite lost, and vtterlie extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; thereby ouerthrowing that true and sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> by which wee are vpholden in most greeuous temptations. Novve therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our <hi>Job,</hi> seeing as it appeareth by the wordes immediately following, he vttered these thinges beeing full of faith and hope, as whose minde was whollie bent to praise and glorifie God, we may hereby gather that he speaketh heere onely of outwarde and externall goods, which the verie prophane philosophers haue distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from those which they call inwarde or internall:
<pb facs="tcp:1955:54"/> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> in that his golden <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> shewing that these are not in our power, draweth from thence many arguments, to perswade men to beare patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the losse of these goods: yet none of them attayned or came neere this true wisedome of <hi>Iob.</hi> For some of them call these the <hi>goods of Fortune,</hi> as if rashly and by chaunce they shoulde come to vs and goe from vs: others onely consider in them a nature inconstant and nothing permanent: and <hi>Epictetus</hi> frameth mens mindes rather to a blockish and senselesse careelessenesse, then to true patience, grounded vpon good and sure rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But this our <hi>Job</hi> furnished with the knowledge of GOD, both naturall as also spirituall and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, (whereof the former confuteth the vaine and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish imaginations of the philosophers, which the Apostle <hi>Saint Paul</hi> noteth in his Epistle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the first Chapter, and 21. verse. and the other doeth enlighten and make perfite this, beeing thorough originall sinne greatlie darkened and obscured) and reliyng him selfe whollie vpon Gods prouidence, hath left a most singular example of patience to be looked into, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of vs, when soeuer we are tryed with the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. For through impatiencie in these temptations, some are caryed into blasphemie, others to reuenge, others into diuers sortes of turbulent and troublesome affections: finally some are violently borne vpon the rocke of desperation; for as much as they set their whole minde and cogitation vpon the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues which they haue lost, and therefore they are greeued for the losse of them, and burne in hatred and desire of reuenge against those, whome they imagine to haue done them this iniurie, and to haue beene the cause of all their miserie. Contrariwise they that are rightly perswaded of the prouidence of GOD, and by the example of <hi>Iob</hi> doe acknowledge God to bee the most iust and wise gouernour of all thinges, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in generall, but in particular, they of all others doe finde out that most quiet and safe hauen, wherein, hauing
<pb facs="tcp:1955:55"/> beene tossed with neuer so violent stormes of afflictions, they doe quietlie remaine. Notwithstanding this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, doth not in like manner comfort and pacifie all men, as it did <hi>Job,</hi> which we see in the like calamities doth come also into the minde of verie wicked men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requisite here wiselie to distinguish. For as it is not ynough for a man, who hath had any thing stolne from him, to finde the theefe, especiallie if he be such a one, of whome he can not recouer his losses, neither by force nor by law: so not whosoeuer beeing in miserie, thinketh that he hath to doe with God, doeth hence by and by take comfort; but he onely, who with reuerence rightlie and religiouslie thinketh vpon God. Giue me therefore a rich man, who is suddenly fallen into pouertie, or any other vpon whome some far lighter affliction is laid, be it that he haue before his eyes &amp; in his remembrance continually nothing else, but the power of God in punishing and reuenging sinne, what shall you heare come from him, but meere blasphemies against God himselfe, &amp; horrible outcries of a man desperate &amp; forlorne? Also giue me a man, who feeling the burden of sinnes, by which he acknowledgeth Gods hand to be worthilie laide vpon him, be it that the same man ioyne with Gods power his iust iudgement and goe no further: I will marueile if he doe not follow the example of <hi>Saule,</hi> or the traytour <hi>Iudas,</hi> or else passe ouer his life in great wretchednesse. And for this cause the Scripture calleth a conscience wounded with sinne, a going downe into the graue. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. What then is to be done? Surelie, hee, who iudgeth him selfe to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for his sinnes (as for the most part we ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues) must ioyne with a true and inward feeling of Gods power &amp; iustice, not onely that knowledge of Gods goodnes and mercie, which reason it selfe teacheth vs by infinit testimonies, which with our eies we may euery where behold in his creatures both in heauen and in earth; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that assured persuasion, which onely the holie Ghost tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the schoole of the <hi>Church,</hi> bearing witnesse with the spirite of euery one of the elect, that God is there most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Father, giuing them a hart broken with the sense and burden of their sinnes, but yet by little and little through the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:55"/> mercie of God taken hold of by faith, marueilouslie recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and at the length throughlie pacified. But if he be led by good cōiectures to thinke, that this affliction doth not befall him for any sinne of his (although in the meane time he confesse him selfe a great sinner) but that God by this meanes eyther tryeth him, or teacheth him patience, or else vseth him to the setting forth &amp; manifesting of his owne glorie, then, no doubt looking directlie vnto God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his minde and cogitation whollie setled vpon him, he forthwith findeth not onely matter of great comfort, but of ioy, which cannot be vttered. For what is it that a iust man should rather desire, then to haue occasion giuen him, to make knowne the virtue and honestie of his minde? what can a painefull scholler rather wish, then of through continuall studie and exercise of a rude <hi>a. b. c.</hi> boye to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a learned man? what may a man vvhich loueth his owne health rather seeke, then by Phisicke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good meanes to preuent those diseases which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he is likelie to fall into? finallie wherein doth a stout &amp; valiant souldiour, desiring to maintaine and increase the honour of his Captaine, wherein, I say, doth he more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, then euen to spende his blood in his captaines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, to purchase him a glorious victorie and triumph? In which kinde of conflict, this speciall thing is not to be forgotten, that there can be no more glorious conquest then to dye in this fight: neither surelie is this so much to be counted a death, as an entrance into that most true, happie, and euerlasting life. But what if (as here wee see it falleth out with <hi>Job</hi>) in such afflictions we be not at all pricked or troubled in conscience, if also we cannot perswade our selues that God will laie so harde a triall vpon vs, what I say, if our minde be disquieted, knowing nothing at all, why God should deale with vs in this māner? what are we to do in this case? Truly we must leaue of al reasoning, and praise god with thanksgiuing, because although for secret and hidden causes he hath thus decreed of vs, notwithstanding he doeth nothing but most wisely and most iustly, as beeing wisdome and iustice it selfe: yea and howsoeuer it seeme otherwise to flesh and blood, doeth not decree, nor yet will haue any
<pb facs="tcp:1955:56"/> thing done, but for the great good and profit of his children, as beeing vnto them a most mercifull Father and redeemer in his Sonne Christ. For all this <hi>Iob</hi> acknowledgeth in the verie extremitie of all his miseries, as afterward it shalbe shewed. But to the end we may the better perceiue, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Jobs</hi> courage and constancie, let vs a little more nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consider, how many and how terrible monsters he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame with this clubbe, that I may so call it, of Gods Prouidence. Doubtlesse the number of them hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beene very smal, who either wanting riches, haue not greedily sought after them, or else, who being borne or made rich, haue not put their trust and confidence in their riches. For which cause our Sauiour Christ telleth vs, that it is a marueilous hard thing for rich men to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen, &amp; Paul not in one place teacheth, that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes is plaine idolatrie. But our <hi>Job</hi> doth in the 29. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this booke, manifestlie witnesse of him selfe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing constrayned so to doe through the bitter and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate accusations of his vncourteous friends, that his hart was not set vpon his riches, and that he possessed them not with loue, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> speaketh; the losse of which he did so patientlie beare, beeing at once and that of a sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all. Behold therefore how the <hi>desire of riches</hi> in getting them, and the <hi>loue of riches</hi> in possessing them, two most cruell monsters are vanquished. <hi>Job</hi> enioyed great honours and dignities, from all which he was falne, as wee shall afterward vnderstand by his owne testimonie. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he doeth not at all seeke after them. Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two other most fearefull and deformed monsters, namelie <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> mastered and laid along at <hi>Jobs</hi> feet. And no merueile, seeing he whollie casteth him selfe and resteth on the onelie will of God, who giueth and taketh away at his owne good pleasure. If he should haue asked counsell of flesh and blood in these euils, it would haue taught him to distrust GOD, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to fall into desperation, or driuen him to all manner of wicked shiftes and mischieuous practises. But this vvas alwaies farre from his thought, as vvho had setled all his hope in the prouidence of God. Behold therefore a glorious
<pb facs="tcp:1955:56"/> victorie and triumph both ouer a <hi>preposterous loue of this life &amp;</hi> ouer <hi>distrust</hi> the mother of all sinne: vanquished both at one time. The losse of his 10. children at once, by so sudden &amp; rare a mishappe, how farre might it haue carried him beyond the bounds of al patience and moderation? and yet <hi>Job</hi> speaketh not one word of it; although he were not voide of affection toward them, as appeareth by his carefull bringing of them vp. Behold therefore a naturall affection, that is, a most tender fatherlie affection, gouerned &amp; ordered aright ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of true mediocritie, wherein we see very many (<hi>David</hi> him selfe shalbe in the number) do offend one way or other, and that vnder the shewe of vertue. To conclude, this patience of <hi>Job</hi> was greate, wonderfull, and vnspeakeable, vvhich GOD graunt vnto vs that we may in some measure imitate and expresse in our selues,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blessed be the name of the Lord.]</hi> See here I pray you, how good <hi>Iob</hi> doeth glorie ouer Satan, adding this as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall triumph among the rest and aboue the rest of his so manie former victories. For he is not onely contented to beare so great miseries, calamities and afflictions, with a quiet and patient minde, and not to haue once mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured against God, but also, as if so many miseries were so many blessings, he yeldeth most humble thanks to God, as if he had dealt most bountifullie with him. For the spirite of God did inwardlie teach him not following the direction of flesh and blood, that, that our heauenlie Father can not possiblie will the hurt of his children, amongst whome he had experience, that him selfe was one: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, whatsoeuer he doth allot to his beloued children, seeing in the end it turneth to their good, is not onely not to be accounted euill, but further to be reckoned among the blessings of God. Now it is not vnknowne that in the bookes of holie Scripture <hi>by the name of God</hi> is vnderstood God him selfe, and that by an expresse and significant manner of speaking, putting vs in mind that to true &amp; perfit thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing is required not onely the faith of the hart, but also the confession of the mouth.</p>

For blasphemie is that most grieuous sinne, which of set purpose in way of reproche and dishonour, either detracteth from God that which is proper and most agreeable to his nature, or else attributeth somewhat vnto him, which is disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repugnant thereunto, which definition will afterward stande vs in some steade to acquite <hi>Job</hi> of blasphemie in those farre greater conflictes which are behinde. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be accounted blasphemous, whosoeuer spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth blasphemie, as it is one thing to be a lyar, saith <hi>Cicero,</hi> and another thing to tell a lye. For a man can not iustly be said to be blasphemous, vnlesse he bring with him a will and purpose to blaspheme: as <hi>Moses</hi> giueth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande by adding, <hi>the name, Leuit.</hi> chap. 24.16. <hi>He that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeth the name of the Lorde.</hi> And also by <hi>an hie hande,</hi> which signifieth presumption, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15, 30.

And herein I verie well like <hi>Mercers</hi> iudgement, who referreth the former part of this verse to the minde, and the latter to the mouth, shewing that <hi>Iob</hi> neither thought in his heart, nor vttered with his mouth any thing vnmeete and vnworthy of God, in so much that both within and without, he caryed away the victorie and conquest ouer Satan.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T shall not neede to make any recitall of such thinges, as haue bene by vs generally deliuered in the former Chapter, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods prouidence, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented &amp; set forth vnto vs after the manner &amp; fashion of men. Howbeit seeing it hath pleased the holy Ghost here againe to repeate the same things, and in the same forme of wordes, to beate vpon the same point; it may appeare very euidently, that we are hereby put in mind, howe profitable and necessarie a thing it is for vs, most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our greatest and most grieuous temptations, still to haue our mindes fixed vpon the <hi>divine Providence:</hi> that, whether we be chastened and corrected, we rest not in those scourges, and instruments which God vseth, but considering that we haue to deale with God him selfe, lay aside all desire of reuenge, after the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10, 11. and humble our selues vnder the mightie hand of God, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6 or whether the Lorde by this meanes maketh triall of vs (as here he did of <hi>Iob</hi>) we doe followe this example of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and constancie in <hi>Iob:</hi> or whether finallie we are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the glorie of his holy name, we be so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faint hearted or discouraged, that, casting our eyes vpon our chiefe captaine and gouernour, we be stirred vp euen to yeelde him most heartie thankes, for that to vs <hi>it is giuen not onely to beleeue, but also to suffer for his sake, Philip.</hi> 1.29. All which comforts depend vpon the sence and feeling of Gods prouidence. The naming of <hi>a day</hi> in this place, and that of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:58"/> one certaine and peculiar <hi>day</hi> (for so hath the originall text) doeth not in any wise belong, as we haue saide, vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpose of God, which taketh place euen in euery singular and particular thing, (forasmuch as this is eternall, and therefore goeth before all time) but it hath relation to the manifestation and execution of that decree, whereunto the Lord hath prescribed certaine times and seasons, which cannot be altered. Which point is of vs diligently to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, to the ende we may the better perswade our selues, not onely that nothing happeneth vnto vs by chaunce, but also, that all those thinges which the Lord from all eternitie hath decreed, whether they concerne prosperitie or aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, are begunne, continued, and ended in those very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of time, which he hath likewise appointed from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting; that thus we neither be wearied with looking and hoping for good thinges, nor, suffering affliction, offende through impatiencie, or, after the manner of the wicked, of whome the Apostle speaketh, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. dreame or imagine that many thinges shall neuer be, because it is so long before they come to passe: but rather stay our selues wholly vpon Gods most wise &amp; righteous will &amp; pleasure, in whose power alone are all opportunities of times and seasons. Finally, whereas Satan againe offers him selfe into this assemblie, it declareth vnto vs two thinges. The one is, that the children of God hauing escaped the daunger of one tempest, are not by and by to looke for a calme, but rather hauing receiued blowes more or lesse, to prepare and addresse them selues to vndergoe farre greater, if it shall so please the Lorde. The other is, that Satan and his ministers can not goe one jote beyond the boundes and limits of their commission, no not euen then, when God doeth as it were let loose the raynes vnto thē, and also that he hauing finished his tēptation, can not otherwise chuse, but present him selfe before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of God, from whome he receiued his warrant. And this is it, which euen nowe I said, that the execution of the decrees of Almightie God, not onely beginneth at the time set and appointed, as we haue alreadie seene; but also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth and goeth forward, as we see, and at the length haue an ende, as we shall see afterward in the 38. Chap. All which
<pb facs="tcp:1955:58"/> God disposeth at his owne pleasure, <hi>who will not suffer his to be tempted aboue that they are able,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. neither yet will he at any time suffer vs so to be pressed downe, that we be by any meanes ouerwhelmed, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8.</p>

                     </bibl> Then the Lorde saide vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? and Satan answered the Lorde, and said, From compassing the earth to &amp; fro, &amp; from walking in it.</p>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>VERSE 3.</hi>
                     </bibl> And the Lord said vnto Satan, Hast thou set thy heart vpon my seruant Job, howe (there is) none such as he <hi>(like him)</hi> in the earth, an vpright and iust man, one that feareth God and escheweth euill, as who still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his vprightnesse? And yet thou diddest mooue me with him <hi>(that is, against him)</hi> that I should swallow him vp without a cause.</p>
               </q>
               <p>IN this question or demaund compared with the answere of Satan, we haue very notably described vnto vs, what is the nature and propertie of that vncleane spirite, as also of all those in whome he beareth rule. For they are obstinately &amp; rebelliously bent either flatly to deny the trueth against their owne conscience, or else shamelesly to dissemble that, which they know to be most true, both before God and man. So in time past this wicked spirite and no other spake in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent vnto the woman; <hi>yea,</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath God indeede said, ye shall not eate of euery tree of the garden?</hi> howbeit this false de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer knew it right well. <hi>Saul,</hi> though conuicted by his owne confession and testimonie, yet ceaseth not to persecute <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> as a rebel, or as one that lay in waight for the kingdome. So <hi>Judas,</hi> for all that his treason was so often and so plainely detected by his Lord &amp; Master <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> the Sonne of the eternall God: yet neuerthelesse still he goeth forward &amp; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the meanes how to betray him. And there is nothing more sure, then that Satan doth infect all mankind with this venemous poyson of his, as appeareth by many wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men otherwise very holy and religious. For thus <hi>Sara</hi> denied that she laughed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.15. Notwithstanding these and such like follies of Gods children howsoeuer in thē selues they are euill, yet they do not proceede of any hatred of God, or of a wicked or reprobate mind: but rather from a
<pb facs="tcp:1955:59"/> preposterous feare, or from some other like infirmitie, which is the cause that the godly can suffer them selues to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued and corrected. This is euident by the example of <hi>Peter.</hi> Let this be our lesson therefore, alwayes to imbrace and lay holde vpon the trueth, forasmuch as we are indued with the spirite of trueth, and to abhorre all falshood and lyes together with the father and authour thereof. Furthermore let vs not tarie and looke while God cite vs before his seate of iudgement, as here he did Satan, and as it fared with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. but setting before our eyes another farre better and more commendable example of the same <hi>Dauid,</hi> let vs freely and of our owne accord confesse and condemne our sinnes, first and principally to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.5. and then also vnto our neighbour, and that by the commaundement of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23. &amp; 18.15. &amp; lastly if it shall so be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, euen vnto the whole Church, <hi>Acts.</hi> 19.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hast thou set thy heart &amp;c.]</hi> The Lord vsed the verie same wordes in that former assembly, whereof we haue spoken in the chapter going before. But in this repetition is included a verie bitter taunt &amp; sharpe reprehension, as if God should haue said, Art thou not ashamed, Satan, thus to answere me, as if I had forgottē, what I granted thee in our last meeting? &amp; thus in my presence to dissemble, that I am foūd to be most true of my worde, and thou a most false and malitious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer? I perceiue thou wilt alwayes be like thy selfe, whollie bent and set vpon mischief, though thou art not able to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Iobs</hi> faith and constancie, which by so many and sundrie meanes thou hast assaulted. From hence we may gather this obseruation, that the godly in their greatest and most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous temptations, howsoeuer it may seeme that God layeth them open and naked to the will and tyrannie of Satan and the whole world, yet haue God present with them, who seeth their conflict; neither is he onely an idle beholder, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly he ministreth vnto them strength and courage. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto pertaineth that saying of the Apostle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.13. <hi>J am able</hi> (saith he) <hi>to doe all thinges through the helpe of Christ, which strengtheneth me;</hi> as also that which he affirmeth of the crowne layed vp for him by the most righteous iudge, 2. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1955:59"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet thou diddest mooue me</hi> (that I should striue) <hi>with him, to swallowe him vp without a cause.]</hi> The meaning of these words is this. Although <hi>Iob</hi> be so holie and vertuous a man, yet thou hast left no meanes vnassayed, that I being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thy false and forged accusations, might wholly at once destroy him, and that as we nowe plainely see, without any his desert. Here ariseth a doubt howe this can agree, (I say, not with Satan that continuallie accuseth Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,) but with the eternall God, to testifie such thinges as these of him selfe. For can we truely say, that God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he deale in mercie or in iustice, is mooued by any other meanes then of him selfe alone? howe then may we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the Lorde God, at the request of Satan, vvas mooued with displeasure against <hi>Iob,</hi> and that vndeserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? To the first difficultie I answere thus. Almightie God neuer did associate vnto him selfe any counsellour for the determining of any thing: nay, if we shall speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he is not, no not of him selfe mooued and stirred vp, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men, to appoint and ordaine this thing or that: but he is altogether in him selfe vnchaungeable from all eternitie, and hath also in him selfe and of him selfe from euerlasting willed and decreed all whatsoeuer he hath willed and decreed. But yet as hee hath appointed times and seasons, so also hath he ordained secondarie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for the accomplishing of those his eternall decrees. So in the fourth of <hi>Genesis</hi> the Lorde testifieth, that he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked by the crye of <hi>Abels</hi> blood, to take vengeance vpon <hi>Cain.</hi> The like is recorded of the sinne of the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> and the inhabitaunts of <hi>Gomorrha, Gen.</hi> 18.20. Againe on the other side, the Lorde declareth that he was mooued with the pitifull cryes and complayntes of his people, to deliuer them out of their captiuitie, <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 3. vers. 7. So beeing reconciled vnto vs by that sole and onely Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour CHRIST IESVS, hee doeth also heare vs, alwayes keepe, defende, and protect vs. So likewise doeth hee manie times, for the prayers of the godlie, eyther differre or else asswage and mittigate the punishmentes most due vnto the wicked and vngodly, as may be shewed by sundrie and almost infinite examples.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:60"/> To conclude, so doeth he spare the penitent and repentant. Therefore in respect of middle causes, which serue as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the actuall perfourming of his eternall decree, and are in their appointed times apparant, it may not vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said, that the Lord is, after a manner proper to himself, mooued, both to shew mercie, and also to execute his most iust iudgements. Neuerthelesse we must here consider an exceeding great difference. For so often as he either spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the penitent, or blesseth those who are carefull in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their dueties, this his bountifulnesse is not to bee imputed either to any mans repentance, or to the merite of good workes, or to the excellencie and worthinesse of faith, but it is onely and whollie to bee ascribed to the free grace and mercie of God, because from the selfe same fountaine also doe flowe both repentance and faith, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the fruites and effectes of the same. But where the question is concerning the punishments due to sinne, wee must acknowledge that the true and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cause thereof is to be sought and to be found in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners them selues.</p>
               <p>The second doubt may thus be resolued: God doeth not say that Satan did winne him by his perswasions, to destroy that innocent and iust man <hi>Iob,</hi> but that Satan went about to obtaine this at his handes, by charging <hi>Iob</hi> with many false and slaunderous accusations. For this can not truely be saide of God, that as he suffereth him selfe to be ledde by the prayers and supplications of his children, so doeth he also yeelde some thing to the request of Satan or his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, (vnlesse peraduenture it be for their owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as appeareth by this historie of <hi>Iob</hi>) no not then, when as he doeth either whollie or in some parte permit and suffer that to be done, which the wicked most earnestly desire. For he doeth not effect any such thing, because hee is willing to graunt their demaundes, or else in any wise to gratifie them, but because he hath before decreed to bring these thinges to passe by their ministerie, and that to a good ende; which they desire for a verie euill intent and a most wicked purpose, as might be shewed by manifolde examples. We are therfore thus to vnderstande that, which the Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:1955:60"/> both before hath suffered to be done against <hi>Iob</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of Satan, and also that which afterwarde he shall permit and suffer, onely vpon an entent to trye and prooue his seruaunt, and not vtterly to destroy him, as Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was: yea Gods purpose herein is, in this his seruant to triumph ouer Satan: so farre is he from being willing for Satans pleasure, to suffer this good man <hi>Iob</hi> to be cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which thing truely can not be spoken without horrible blasphemie.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>VERSE 4.</hi>
                  </bibl> And Satan answered the Lorde, and saide, Skinne for skinne, and vvhatsoeuer is a mans, <hi>(that is, whatsoeuer a man hath)</hi> vvill hee giue for his life.</q>
               <p>IN that Satan so manifestly convicted, dares notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing still make answere vnto the Lorde, it declareth howe greatly this vncleane spirite is delighted with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickednesse. From hence it commeth, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as none can easily be brought to renounce and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake that wherein he taketh speciall delight, hence I say it commeth that he is neuer wearyed with committing sinne. And therefore he can neither be sayde to sinne of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither yet can he euer so much as once bethinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of any amendement. To this nature and diuelish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Satan, they of all other come neerest, whome the Scripture vseth to call sinners, that is to say, such as make as it were an arte and occupation of sinning: whose heart if it shall continue vnpenitent to the ende, vndoubtedly their portion shall bee all one with his in euerlasting destruction. But we on the contrarie parte, if we be the true children of GOD, albeit no man is free from sinne; yet let vs, by the ayde and assistance of that good Spirite which we haue receiued, aboue all thinges be carefull, that we sinne not of malice against the trueth, nor with a certaine hatred of vertue and goodnesse. For this is altogether diuelish: but if it so fall out, that we haue sinned and fallen through infirmitie, let vs offer vp vnto the Lorde a contrite heart, which is a gift proceeding euen from him selfe vnto vs, and let vs in no case resist his chastis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:1955:61"/> and correction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Skinne for skinne]</hi> It is not to be doubted, but that this is a proverbiall kinde of speach, the true meaning and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whereof seemeth vnto me very harde and difficult. For whereas many will haue the sence to be this; that the life of euery one is so deare vnto him, that he will not sticke, to raunsome and redeeme his owne skinne, though it bee with the skinne of another, that is to say, if he shall come into ieopardie of his life, he will be most forward and readie to bring another into perill of death, rather then to vndergo the daunger him selfe: as if Satan in this speach had relation vnto the death of <hi>Jobs</hi> children; I can not like of this their interpretation, because that which verie seldome falleth out, may hardly be thought to minister occasion of a prouerbiall speach. For what if <hi>Job,</hi> as a tender and most louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towardes his children, had rather bene readie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture him selfe for them euen to the death, if it might so haue pleased the Lorde? Surely if this were the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this place, in the originall should haue bene added this worde <hi>(his)</hi> as well in the first parte of the sentence, namely <hi>(For his skinne)</hi> as in the lattet, <hi>(For his life.)</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they yet content me, who alleadge further, that men wil not refuse, euen with the losse of some one of their members, to preserue the rest of their bodie aliue: which exposition seemeth to mee lesse probable then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For thus the speach should not rise from the lesse to the greater, nor any thing at al be aggrauated, but rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished; for so much as it is a greater matter for a man to redeeme his life with one of his members, then with all that he possesseth beside. My iudgement therefore is, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in this prouerbe woulde signifie thus much, namely, that <hi>Iob</hi> as yet had suffered nothing, but onely in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde or externall goods; the losse whereof is a thing so common to men of all estates, that men doe oftentimes voluntarilie sustaine one losse and dammage, for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and eschewing of another. And the rather, because these temporall goods are such, as may againe without any great difficultie be recouered, yea, and sometimes the losse of one commodity, may be an occasion of obtaining a farre
<pb facs="tcp:1955:61"/> greater: in which respect that worthie <hi>Themistocles,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, beeing banished out of his owne countrey, hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued greater honours and wealth at the handes of <hi>Darius</hi> the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> then euer hee had enioyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was wont to saye, <hi>Perijssem, nisi perijssem:</hi> that is, <hi>If J had not lost all, J shoulde surely haue lost all.</hi> Therefore by the name of <hi>skinne</hi> in this place, wee must after a prouerbiall manner of speaking, vnderstande the outwarde goods which are belonging to a man, with the which he is as it were, couered, and which are no parte of the man him selfe: the losse whereof in parte, men, if so bee vrgent necessitie shall so constraine them, can in some sorte suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer without falling into despaire: but yet for <hi>skinne,</hi> and what is that? surely this, that making much of that which is left, or at the least, keeping their liues out of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they may afterwarde recouer their losses. But if the life it selfe shall once come in ieopardie, then men are readie and willing without any exchaunge or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to forgoe all whatsoeuer they possesse, without exception: as it commonly falleth out with mariners, when they are in extreame daunger of shippe wracke: and the reason is, because men can not recouer the losse of their liues, as they may the losse of their goods. The drift therefore and scope of Satan in this speach is (as we haue sayde) nothing else but thus to shewe that <hi>Iob</hi> was not yet touched to the quicke: that those blowes which he had hitherto receiued, not onely fetched no blood, but scarcely touched his skinne and flesh: that he rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced for his owne safetie and preseruation, then sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for the losses he had sustained, and therefore that it was no marvaile, though he were not at all discouraged, neither yet brake foorth into any bitter and expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting speaches against GOD, not for that he did serue and worshippe GOD from his heart, but partly for the loue hee bare vnto him selfe, and partly because hee still enioying his life and limmes, hoped in time to bee restored to his former, or to a much better estate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here shall be a double opposition, namely, betweene
<pb facs="tcp:1955:62"/>
                  <hi>skinne,</hi> and all <hi>vvhich a man possesseth</hi> and for <hi>his life,</hi> the speach as I said, rising from the lesse to the greater: so that we may seeme more fitlie for <hi>(and all that is a mans,)</hi> to translate, <hi>(But all that is a mans.)</hi> Neither may this verse in <hi>French</hi> vnfitlie be expressed after this manner, <hi>Vn homme donnera bien vne peau pour vne peau, mais il donnera tout ce qu'il a pour sauuer sa vie:</hi> that is, <hi>a man wil willingly giue skinne for skinne, but he vvill giue all that he hath to saue his life.</hi> This Christ considering, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. and sharplie reproouing this kinde of men, who make greater account of this life, then of any other thing whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, he sheweth that none doe worse prouide for them selues, then they who making this their onelie care, howe they may preserue and cherish this life, do thereby purchase to them selues their owne ruine and finall destruction. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan therefore knowing right well, that this is a common vice in all vnregenerate men, as he, who had long before preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against <hi>Adam</hi> by this temptation and made him, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing Gods displeasure, to draw vengeance vpon his owne head, Satan, I say, dares, (like a vile and desperate wretch as he is) assure him selfe, that <hi>Job,</hi> if he were so farre forth vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tormented with some grieuous and vntollerable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease or sickenes, that their might be no longer hope of life, would at the length discouer and bewraye, how that all this time he had serued God not of any true or vnfaigned zeale, nor yet for the loue of vertue and righteousnes, but because he found by experience that this worshipping of God was verie profitable and gainefull vnto him: which commoditie ceasing and all hope of life beeing quite taken away, he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, but to prooue that prouerbe true, <hi>No longer pennie, no longer Pater noster.</hi> And yet notwithstanding <hi>Job</hi> in this trial and temptation of his, howsoeuer (by meanes that Satan had bewitched both his wife, and those friendes also that came to comfort him, to vse such speeches, as grieued &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his righteous soule) howsoeuer, I say, he oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed the infirmitie of flesh and blood; neuerthelesse he was alwaies so farre from that, whereunto Satan laboured to bring him, that still in word and in deed he witnessed the cleane contrarie.</p>

               <p>HEre therefore Satan doeth confesse, (though very much against his will) that he hath no abilitie at all to hurt, howsoeuer this is the only thing he desireth, vnlesse he hath receiued power and licence from God. But here also he playeth the sophister, so reasoning, as if forsooth God should be the onelie dealer in this action, or as if the worke of Satan him selfe were the very worke of God, wherewas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (as we haue more fullie declared in the Chapter goeing before) in all such like wicked actions, euell instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do not deserue so much as the name of instruments, in respect of their owne proper worke, so farre as they doe that which they do of their free will and inward euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but onely so farre foorth as God vseth them, beeing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so euill and sinnefull instruments, for the effecting and bringing to passe of his owne peculiar worke, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies most iust. Here therefore are two handes, very repugnant the one to the other, yet concurring to the one and the same effect, namelie to giue <hi>Iob</hi> many and grieuous woundes, but with a diuerse end and cleane contrarie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For God striketh <hi>Job,</hi> not of any displeasure or intent to doe him harme, but he propounded vnto him selfe this end in <hi>Iobs</hi> visitation and triall, namelie, to get the conquest ouer Satan and all his mallice, and gloriouslie to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him in the constancie of his seruant; whome also he would by this meanes bring into the way of a farre greater felicitie. In like manner Satan▪ he also striketh <hi>Job:</hi> and why so? surelie that he might compell him to blaspheme God to his vtter vndoeing. This was it, which Satan attempted with great force &amp; violence, but yet to small effect.

<pb facs="tcp:1955:63"/> as if wishing a curse vnto himselfe (although he were alreadie accursed, and sentence of eternall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had long agoe passed against him, which may neuer be recalled) he should say thus. Let me be confounded, or, let me presentlie be cast and throwne downe headlong into the bottomelesse pitte, if this <hi>Iob,</hi> whome thou so entirely louest, and whom thou esteemest &amp; also affirmest to be of so sound and faithfull hart towardes thee, doe not as it were reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie spit in thy face, and reuile the with open blasphemie. Where againe we may behold the vncorrigible impudencie of this cursed spirit, in that he durst in this sort, and euen in Gods presence to reprooue him eyther of ignorance, or of a lye. By how much the more it shalbe our parts, to beseech the Lord, that he will not giue vs ouer eyther to the power of Satan, or to our owne wicked and rebellious lustes, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ruled by them; considering, that euen that faithfull seruant of God, <hi>Peter,</hi> was through an vnordinate feare so carried out of the right way (for we may not impute it to any vngodlie and wicked disposition) that with the false denial of his Lord and Master, he ioyned a most fearefull imprecation and curse, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.74. which as it may serue, for a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the great infirmitie and weakenes of man on the one part, so of the infinite and vnspeakeable loue of God on the other. Now albeit we read of holie men, who haue vsed the like imprecations: yet they did it to a farre other ende and purpose, that is, eyther for the auouching of truth, or gainesaying of falshoode, alwaies keeping, as, an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right &amp; sincere conscience before God; so a true and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue towardes their brethren: but especially herein they forget not to vse all reuerence due to the maiestie of God which may appeare by this, that they eyther wholy conceale the curse, or else expresse it vndirectly and indefinitely, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>So and so let God doe vnto me.</hi> Abominable therefore are those speeches, which are too too common in mens mouthes, when they wil make any protestation, yea &amp; when they know it to be most false, which they would auouch to be true.

                  </bibl> Then the Lord said vnto Satan, Lo, he is in thine hand, but saue his life.</q>
               <p>THat which before we said, here we may repeat againe, namely that God, although sometimes he suffer that to be done, which Satan and the wicked men of this world doe earnestly desire; neuerthelesse he doth not alow and accept of their praiers, but only graunteth vnto them such things, as redound to their hurt. And surely God yealdeth not to their requests, for any loue he beareth them, or because he would gratifie them, but rather in great anger and displeasure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, for their owne ouerthrow and final destruction, that they may become instruments of their owne miserie. Therefore it is very well and truly saide of <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> that euill counsell is commonly most hurtfull to them that giue it: also an other heathen writer greatly complaineth of their follie, who craue such things at gods hand, which for the most part are an occasion of their ruine and destruction. Concerning whome, <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hath made a very large and excellent discourse. But on the contrarie part, whereas the Lord doth eyther not at all graunt vnto his children, that which they desire of him, or else doth for some time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that which he is purposed to bestow vpon them, he doth it not for any displeasure conceiued against them, but eyther because he hath otherwise determined in himselfe (for which cause wee see that he refused to heare the prayer of <hi>Samuel,</hi> made in the behalfe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and also the prayer of <hi>David,</hi> for the childe begotten in adulterie) or else because he can better tell howe to prouide for the good of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then they can them selues, who craue this thing or that at his handes. In this respect he telleth the sonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> that they know not what they aske, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.22. and in the 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. he giueth this answere vnto <hi>Paul, My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> But here we must obserue one thing further, namely, that the person of <hi>Iob</hi> is one thing, &amp; his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance another: &amp; that man him selfe is more worth a great deale, then all that which he possesseth: which forasmuch as cōmon sense doth sufficiently teach, who can but marueile to see how foolish the most part of men are, who are not so much masters ouer their riches, as their riches masters ouer them?
<pb facs="tcp:1955:64"/> The heathen philosphers crie out against this madnesse: but they crie in vaine, and who is he that giueth them the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? Likewise the <hi>Lyric</hi> Poet reprooueth them, fot that being desirous to liue, they depriue them selues of all those thinges which might make their life sweete and pleasaunt vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But saue his life.]</hi> Here then a restraint is made, that wee may knowe, howe that <hi>Iob</hi> was not one of that number, whome the Lorde doeth so deliuer vp whollie vnto Satan, that he may deale with them at his owne pleasure: which neuerthelesse as the Apostle affirmeth, sometimes falleth out for a season euen vnto such, as afterwardes shall be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirite of repentance, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2.26. And hereof also there fall out daily many and sundrie examples. We are therefore very carefully to take heede, that we despaire not of any man, no not then, when his conuersation doeth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifie, that his will is subiect to Satan, who leadeth him this way and that way as he listeth. But it is our dueties to pray to God for euery one, though he be neuer so grieuous a sinner, yea we must louingly tender, and by all meanes procure the saluation of all men, vnlesse peraduenture any haue committed that sinne which is vnto the death, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that one vnpardonable sinne spoken of, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.16. and which is rather knowen vnto God, then vnto men. Nowe if it be not safe for vs to lay aside all hope concerning the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of any, though for a time they live vnder the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Satan: much lesse may we take vpon vs to determine of Gods loue or hatred, either by the losse of temporall goods and blessings, or else by those manifold and greeuous infirmities whereunto a mans bodie is subiect, and into which it doeth oftentimes fall. For so that wise King, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I may say the holy Ghost, doeth most diuinely teach in the ninth Chap. of <hi>Ecclesiastes:</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> also propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto vs his owne example, <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. For these thinges are oftentimes, not that rod of iron, wherewith God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in pieces, but his fatherly correction which he layeth vpon his children, to the ende they may not fall into the same condemnation with the worlde, and therfore they are testimonies, not of Gods heauy wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:64"/> against which <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Psalme.</hi> 6. and 38. but of a minde, though somewhat displeased, yet very loiung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and tenderlie affected towardes vs: otherwhiles they are probations and trials, which fall out for their great good, who in the same, by Gods ayde and assistance, shew them selues valiant and couragious, as we may see in this very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Iob.</hi> To conclude, these are sometimes no signes or tokens at all of Gods anger or displeasure, but contrariwise of his great and singular fauour and good will, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the crosse which is alwaies an vnspeakeable companion vnto true and vnfaygned godlines. For so Christ teacheth euery where, still setting his owne example before our eyes; in so much that all such like miseries and afflictions, howe great and grieuous soeuer they be, are by the example of the Apostle reckoned vp among the speciall gifts and graces of God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. herein following that which our Sauiour Christ teacheth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. These differences if <hi>Iobs</hi> friends had diligentlie waighed and considered, they would not in such sort haue aggrauated and redoubled his sorowes, as to become in a manner more grieuous vnto him, then was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan him selfe. The <hi>Epicures,</hi> concerning this point are rather to be abhorred and detested of vs, then confuted; who ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue knowledge of these things, nor yet will vouchsafe to learne them: whereupon it commeth to passe that they voluntarilie commit this most horrible sinne, into which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan laboured to draw <hi>Iob</hi> by all possible meanes, though all his indeauours were made frustrate and voide of that effect, which he hoped for. Now although the sense of this place may very well beare, that by this worde <hi>(anima)</hi> in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin translation, (which we here haue translated <hi>life</hi>) may be vnderstood that other part of <hi>Job,</hi> distinct from his bodie, namelie his minde or soule, into which it was not lawfull for Satan to enter, as he did into the hart of <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytour: albeit with the greatnes of his griefe and miserie on the one side; and with the vnconsiderate checkes and accusations of his friendes on the other side, Satan as it had beene with hammers of steele, did mightilie beat at the doores of <hi>Iobs</hi> hart: yet notwithstanding there is no doubt, but here it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for life, in which signification it is most commonly vsed.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:65"/> Hereby the Lord would giue Satan to vnderstand, that he had giuen him leaue, to strike <hi>Job</hi> with the most fearefull and vntollerable disease or sickenes, which he could deuise, and yet so, that it should not be mortall, nor take away his life from him. Therefore in like manner, this word <hi>(Saue)</hi> doeth not yeald any such interpretation, as if any saluation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation were from Satan, who rather is delighted in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much, as in the ruine and destruction of all things: but this word is attributed to him, because after a sort he may seeme, to saue and preserue those things, which either he can not at all touch, or, if power be so farre giuen him, as here it was ouer <hi>Iobs</hi> bodie, yet he can in no case proceede further, to the hurting or destroying of the whole; and that, because God doeth limit and restraine the desire and practises of this mischieuous spirite, with in those boundes, which in his good pleasure he hath appointed.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1955:65"/> meanes Satan could, especiallie in so short a time, worke this great alteration in <hi>Iobs</hi> bodie; I answere, that, forasmuch as diseases growe not onely of inward, but also of outward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and forasmuch as it is well knowen, that among all other diseases, especiallie those noysome boyles are ingendered by a venemous and infectious ayre, whereupon they are both called contagious, and are so indeede; there is no cause why we should maruell that Satan, being not vnskilfull how to vse and imploy all naturall causes, and also hauing power giuen him of God, could so speedily bring this to passe. In which respect the Apostle doeth not without good cause call him <hi>the Prince of the aire.</hi> Therefore I doubt not at all, but that many contagious diseases doe verie often arise without any influence of malignant starres, either immediatly being sent of God him selfe, or else stirred vp by angels whether good or bad, but alwayes God willing and decreeing to haue it so, as appeareth not onely out of this place, but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. with which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases God striketh these or those, as he seeth good, some mortally, and other some in such wise as they may be cured. Now as touching internall or inwarde causes, seeing Satan knoweth better then any physition, the constitution &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of our bodyes, and by what contrarie qualities they may be altered, we can not doubt, but that these impure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, so oft as God giueth them licence, haue great power to trouble and chaunge the same temperature, albeit they doe not them selues passe through our bodyes. For what shoulde let them to effect this thing in our bodyes, seeing they haue so great force and power ouer mens mindes; as namely, to mooue and stirre vp all manner of wicked affections in the children of disobedience, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2. To this purpose also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the example of that woman, who had her body bended togither, and who, as our Sauiour Christ witnesseth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.16. was bound of Satan eighteene yeeres: which kinde of disease the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Neuerthelesse, farre be it from vs, that hereupon we should imagine all diseases, by which God punisheth sinne, to be procured and wrought by the meanes of wicked spirits. For most commonly they come of naturall and ordinarie causes, and that of their
<pb facs="tcp:1955:66"/> owne accorde, and therefore they are likewise cured by meere natural medicines, God giuing a blessing to the same; and yet the phisitions are many times compelled, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by these obseruations which they haue left vs in their writings, to acknowledge that in some diseases there is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, I knowe not what, extraordinarie, and such, as is quite beside the course of all naturall causes. Here then we are taught, howe necessarie a thing it is for vs, so to vse naturall medicines, that neuerthelesse we put not our trust in them, nor yet in the phisition. For by the example of <hi>Aza</hi> wee are taught how greatly this sinne displeaseth almightie God, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. But (as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> admonisheth, chap. 5.14. &amp; as <hi>Ezechias</hi> hath taught vs by his example, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20.2. &amp; <hi>Esay</hi> 38.) the godly ought to seeke for helpe no where els, but at Gods hands; who only woundeth and healeth, who leadeth to the graue, and bringeth backe againe.</p>

For although it might seeme that <hi>Iob</hi> of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord sate in the ashes, as the vsage was of those that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; which were an euident testimonie of his patience &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, being in the bitternes of his affliction so farre from breaking foorth into blasphemy: yet because it is here said, that he tooke a potsherd to scrape away the filth of his biles,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:66"/> which it is not likely he would haue done, if so be in his owne house he had bene neuer so little helped by his wife &amp; hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold seruāts, as of good right he ought to haue bene: (foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he had a house, &amp; houshold stuffe, and houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants yet remaining) I rather agree to their iudgement, who thinke that <hi>Job</hi> did all this constrained &amp; of necessity, being forsakē of his wife, seruants, &amp; familiar acquaintance, yea, &amp; by some of them mocked &amp; iested at: which so sudden chāge of al things, we shal heare him afterward bewaile in most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner. But so much the more glorious in the end, was the victorie which he obtained. Such was the cōdition of the Apostles thē selues, &amp; of the true Christian church vnder the emperors of Rome, persecuters of the Christiās, whē as they were reuiled &amp; accounted as the filth of the world, &amp; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skouring of all things. And seeing at this day mighty princes &amp; potentats, being set on by that whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> do folow the steps of those heathen persecuters, this worthy exāple of <hi>Iob</hi> may stād vs in great stead, &amp; therfore <hi>Iames</hi> doth not without good cause wil vs to looke vnto it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.11. Now wheras the Greeke translation in stead of <hi>ashes</hi> or <hi>dust,</hi> mētioneth <hi>dirt or dung, in which Iob sate,</hi> &amp; addeth further, that <hi>Iob</hi> was laid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the city, as if for the stinke &amp; ill sauour which came from him, he was not suffered to abide in the citie; it is not at all foūd in the Hebrue text, &amp; in my iudgemēt is to be reiected.</p>

                  </bibl> And his wife said vnto him, Doest thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in thine vprightnes? Blesse God, and die.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his wife said vnto him.]</hi> We haue heard how <hi>Job</hi> in his great tormēts sate downe in the dust, &amp; taking a potshard in his hand (for peraduenture he could not vse his nailes) wiped away the putrified matter of his biles; but we read not that he spake one word. Which silence of his proceeded neither from any want of feeling either in his body or mind (for how could he chuse but be touched to the quick with so extreme griefs) nor yet frō any pride (which in such estate wil not suffer a mā to be silent) and therefore Satan was hereat maruelously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, looking for nothing lesse, then that <hi>Job</hi> should still retaine that his former patience, without beeing any whit moued with these tormēts, which seemed intollerable. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upō he sendeth <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, who by her venemous words might cōpel him at the least to open his mouth, &amp; vtter something.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:67"/> To what purpose he did this you shall heare afterward. Nowe it shall be sufficient, to shewe that Satan seemeth for three causes to haue made choise of this woman, among the rest of <hi>Iobs</hi> friendes and seruants: whose meanes he doeth in like manner vse afterwarde to bring about the selfe same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. One cause is, because he had from the beginning tried howe easily this sexe may be beguiled, and howe soone they may be brought to beguile others: another, because no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries doe so much vexe and grieue vs, as those which are done by them, at whose handes we rather looked for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe and good will: the thirde and last, that she, who vnder <hi>Job</hi> bare the greatest rule and authoritie in that house, as it were giuing the onset, the rest of <hi>Iobs</hi> seruants which were yet remaining, and likewise his friendes, might be the rather incouraged to followe her euill example. Neither was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan therein deceiued: albeit all was in vaine and to no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as we shall see in that which followeth. But here let vs learne into what vnhappinesse mankinde is fallen, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that oftentimes we doe great hurt and displeasure to those, whome we desire most of all to doe good vnto; as in the wofull example of this woman, and also of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends it most euidently appeareth. Wherefore that <hi>recta ratio,</hi> that is, <hi>right and perfite reason,</hi> of the philosophers, is in no wise suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to rule and moderate our affections. For howsoeuer in generall speculations it may see somewhat, yet when it is applyed to particular actions, it giueth no true and certen direction. Therefore <hi>Gregorie</hi> doeth vpon this place verie well aduise vs, not onely to consider what we doe, but also with what wisedome and discretion we doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doest thou still continue in thine vprightnesse?]</hi> All the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters which I could euer see, albeit some of them will haue this worde <hi>(Blesse)</hi> to be taken in its proper signification, but yet by an ironie; others in a cleane contrarie signification for <hi>(Blaspheme)</hi> all, I say, doe expound this place, as if <hi>Iobs</hi> wife had openly gone about to perswade her husbād to curse god, to the end that dying, he might thus at the least, ease his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, as desperate men are wont to doe. Neither surelie do I denie, but that Satan, to bring <hi>Iob</hi> vnto this point, vsed all manner of violence &amp; torture, which possibly he could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:1955:67"/> taking away his life, which God had expresselie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him not to touch. Notwithstanding to me it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nothing probable, that this matrone hauing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of so godly and well ordered a familie, could so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be brought, to vse such a shamelesse speach vnto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: seeing euen those who are most wicked, vse not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and of set purpose to doe any such thing, but that they propound both to them selues and others, at the least, some shewe of profit, which may redound vnto them: yea, &amp; what hope could Satan conceiue, that <hi>Job</hi> would any whit be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with so foolish and shamelesse a perswasion, which none, were he neuer so wicked a wretch, would euer yeeld vnto, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it were wilfully against his owne conscience? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Greeke translation hath many other thinges, which here are not mentioned, I see not vpon what authoritie they are grounded, in so much as they are not found in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue text. For it standeth with no probabilitie, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue copies should in this place be thus vnperfite, especially wanting so many wordes, seeing the rest of the booke is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and vncorrupt. And moreouer the things them selues may seeme to be false, because we do not read that <hi>Iob</hi> sate vpon the dunghil, or abroade in the open aire, nor yet that <hi>Iobs</hi> owne house wherein he dwelt, was ouerthrowen, or that his wife was cast out of her house: yea, the quite contrarie appeareth by <hi>Iobs</hi> owne wordes in the 7. chap. vers. 4. Nowe then what shall I say? Surely for mine own part, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the iudgement of other interpreters, I dare affirme that this womā doth briefly here handle the self same cause, which <hi>Iobs</hi> friends more amply discourse of afterward. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did she this with any other wil, affection or intent, then they, being also mooued hereto by the same reasons. For she ment nothing lesse, then of set purpose to vexe &amp; grieue <hi>Iob,</hi> or to increase his torments, which were without measure, &amp; greater then euer any mortall man had before that time su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained: but she thought, that this was the onely meanes for <hi>Iob</hi> to obtaine Gods fauour, &amp; to procure his owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for of his life she was altogether out of hope) if he would herein followe her aduise &amp; counsell. For doubtles her will was to counsell him for the best, &amp; not to perswade him any
<pb facs="tcp:1955:68"/> way to offend the maiestie of God. Therefore albeit her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was not wicked (as neither the intent of <hi>Jobs</hi> friendes) yet both she and they deceiued them selues, in supposing that <hi>Iob</hi> was thus afflicted for his sinnes, &amp; as one with whom God was highly displeased: so that this their dealing with <hi>Iob</hi> was very vnaduised and vnconsiderate, by which Satan tooke great aduantage against him. Neither did any in effect so much further Satans enterprise against <hi>Iob,</hi> as they, who neuerthelesse desired nothing more then to procure his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as that disputation betweene <hi>Iob</hi> and his friends doth manifestly declare. It remaineth now that we consider, what counsell this woman gaue to her husbande, what was her minde &amp; purpose, &amp; vvhat Satan endevoured by her meanes to bring to passe. <hi>Jobs</hi> wife agreeing, &amp; according vvith her husband in his former temptation, or at the least not daring by her speach to shevve her selfe any vvay discontented, she seeing him foorthvvith thus fearfully strooken, and rightly iudging that all this could not fall out, vnles God had so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, &amp; after an extraordinarie manner so decreed it; yet herein deeming amisse, that God vvould neuer haue thus ordained, if he had not bin marueilously offended vvith <hi>Iob;</hi> finallie she imagining him novv to be hard at deaths doore; first, she could not sufficiently vvonder to see him all this vvhile sit so still vvithout speaking any vvord, seeming novv not any vvhit more troubled and disquieted in minde, then in time past. Moreouer she thought that this deepe silence, could not proceed of any other cause, thē of a certain hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; stupiditie of conscience, namely her husband being bevvitched vvith a vaine opinion of his ovvne righteousnes, and therefore not marking nor regarding the anger of God fallen vpon him for his sinnes. Herupon it came to passe that she tooke &amp; gaue the same counsel or aduise, vvhich men for good cause vse to giue to guiltie persons, vvho are convicted and ready to suffer the death, vvhich they haue deserued: &amp; what is that? Surely this, that acknowledging his sinnes before God, together with an vtter misliking &amp; detestation of his former life, (for this is nothing else but <hi>to blesse God,</hi> that is, to ascribe glorie to God, &amp; nothing but shame and confusion to our selues for our sinnes &amp; transgressions, as we
<pb facs="tcp:1955:68"/> may see, <hi>Iosu.</hi> 7.19.) and not resting here, but, beseeching God to turne away his displeasure and indignation, and to looke vpon him in his mercie: doeing I say, all this, as now it stoode him in hand, he should addresse him selfe to vndergoe the death which was not farre from him. Whereby it appeareth, that this was the onely point, in which shee was deceiued, namely, in thinking that the miseries of this life, especially so extreeme and so vnaccustomed, could not arise from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her originall, then from Gods anger: which to be most false, the estate of the Church in this world at all times doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prooue, and also prophane histories doe witnesse by diuers examples, in which we may see, that they of all other haue beene most miserable and wretched in respect of all manner of aduersitie, who haue had especiall regard in them selues, of a iust, honest, vpright, and vertuous conuersation. Concerning which thing I shall speake more at large when I come to the fourth Chapter. Verely nothing could be more vnworthely spoken against <hi>Iob,</hi> nothing that coulde bee so bitter and greeuous vnto him: in so much, that whome ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther losse of so many good things, nor the death of al his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor yet the tormenting griefes of his bodie, were able to discourage, this one iniurie had well neere driuen into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration, and deliuered him vp, beeing vanquished into the hands of Satan. For although it neuer came into <hi>Iobs</hi> mind, to stand vpon his owne righteousnes, or to repose the hope of his saluation in any thing else, saue in the mercie of the onely redeemer and Sauiour, which should come, as he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth afterwarde in the 19. Chapter verse 25. and although hauing receiued so many wounds, his thoughts were very much troubled about this; namely, what should be the cause, why God should thus deale more hardly with him, then with other mortall men: notwithhanding as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifest by his wordes which he vsed in the 1. Chapter, verse 21. and as it shall appeare by the verse immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following, the testimonie of a good &amp; vpright consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did so strengthen and vpholde him in all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and aduersities, that, shaking off all contrarie fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, by a wonderfull constancie and stayednesse of minde, he rested in the will and pleasure of almightie God.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:69"/> And surely this was the onely refuge which he had left him, and therefore Satan laboureth by al possible meanes to take it from him, seeking by terrors of conscience, (then which there is nothing more terrible) ioyned with the losse of his goods, and torments of his bodie, to make him forget all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: that so being naked &amp; without armour, he might get the victorie ouer him. In a word therfore, <hi>Iobs</hi> wife miserably deceiuing her selfe, &amp; albeit vnwittingly, yet stoutly fighting against <hi>Iob</hi> vnder Satans banner, woulde in effect say thus much: <hi>Doest thou continue yet in thine vprightnes?</hi> that is, why doest thou, my husband, sit here so silent, bearing thy selfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an opinion of thine integritie? Doest thou not as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how highly God is displeased with thee? <hi>Blesse God,</hi> that is, for so much as thou hast but a very short time to liue, giue the glorie vnto God, as to a iust iudge, and hauing acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the multitude of thine offences, by the greatnesse of the afflictions which he hath laid vpon thee, prepare thy selfe to make a godly ende.</p>

                  <hi>BƲT he saide vnto her, &amp;c.]</hi> Satan by the meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie of this woman, hath gotten thus much, that <hi>Iob</hi> is compelled to breake off his former silence, but yet not to loose any whit of his patience and constancie of minde: yea, by this meanes it came to passe, (farre otherwise then Satan looked for) that <hi>Job</hi> was knowen to be victorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Satan, not onely in the vertue and vprightnes of his heart, but also in the wisdome and godlinesse of his speach. And surely, this is the issue of all Satans practises against the elect, to whome, seeing all thinges fall out for the best, (as the Apostle telleth vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and daily experience also teacheth) so often as the Lorde doeth deale with vs, as here he doeth with <hi>Job,</hi> why doe we not, rather then that wee shoulde expostulate and reason the matter with God, why doe we not, I say, crie out with <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 119.71. <hi>Jt is good for me that I haue bene afflicted.</hi> But seldome it is seene that we
<pb facs="tcp:1955:69"/> behaue our selues so couragiouslie, as this excellent man <hi>Iob</hi> doeth, and yet no man was euer more cruelly and searce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assayled by Satan then he; who so got the victorie ouer Satan, that as yet he rather seemed to contemne his blowes, then to vouchsafe once to meete him in iust combate, and to shewe the vttermost that he was able to doe. Neither herein alone was the vertue of this our champion greatly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, in that he so wisely defeated this subtill enterprise of Satan, his chiefe enemie, shewing no lesse courage nowe in this, then before in patiently bearing and sustaining so great and extreame griefes: but this also is worthie of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in him, that being so vnkindely dealt withall by her, who ought to haue loued and honoured him aboue all others, and hauing so great an iniurie offered him by his wife, neuerthelesse he was not wrathfull against her, nor shewed any great token of anger: yea, he did so moderate and quallifie this his answere, that in reproouing her, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgate that authoritie, which, as a husbande, he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his wife, neither yet did quite lay aside all regarde of womans infirmitie. VVhich good and godly moderation, if husbandes would keepe towardes their wiues, parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their children, masters towardes their seruants, we should haue all thinges both in priuate families, and in whole common wealthes, better and more quietlie ordered, then nowe they are. Albeit I doe not denie, but that men for the most part, doe rather offende in the other extreame, that is to say, in ouermuch remissenesse and lenitie. Nowe this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, doeth consist partly of an increpation or rebuke, and partly of a repulse or confutation. As touching the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, I neither agree to them, who mollifie and mittigate it, by vnderstanding this speach of <hi>Job</hi> interrogatiuely, as if <hi>Iob</hi> should say, May I thinke that thou wouldest speake after the manner of foolish women? neither yet am I of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who take <hi>(foolish)</hi> for madde and wicked, albeit I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the Hebrewe worde <hi>(Nabal)</hi> hath sometimes that signification: and surely it woulde very well agree to this woman, if she had so shamelessely counselled her husbande to curse God: which exposition I haue already confuted. <hi>Foolish</hi> therefore in this place, is opposed to wise and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:70"/> For that which <hi>Iobs</hi> wife would perswade her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was not simply &amp; in it selfe euill; forasmuch as to those who are guiltie and convicted, no counsell can better be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, neither is any admonition more necessarie. But in the application of this counsel, she greatly trespassed against her husband, being nothing lesse then such a one, as she tooke him for; falsely imagining, that his wickednesse was answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the number and greatnes of his calamities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What? shall we receiue good at the hande of God, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue evill?]</hi> How many straunge &amp; wonderfull things doth <hi>Iob</hi> comprehend in very few words? They are wonderful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, especially if we consider in what case he then was. For it is no strange thing to be thankfull for a good turne: but yet what man amongst a thousand reteineth the memorie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued benefits? nay, what one of a thousand burieth not the remēbrāce of al forepassed benefits, hauīg receiued neuer so small an injurie? <hi>Iob</hi> did farre otherwise, who in his former most grieuous trials did not only not murmure against God, taking away whatsoeuer he had before bestowed vpon him, but also gaue god thanks, as if the very losse of his goods had bin a new benefite. But here he is so much the more to be wondred at, by how much this blovv was the more grieuous then all the former: in the beginning he was silēt, which was a very great thing amidst such horrible vexations: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, albeit an vniust accusation were added to those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēts, he brake forth not into any blasphemous murmuring, but into praising of God, sufficiently declaring, what he had meditated vpon in all the time of his silence, to wit, Gods so many blessings bestowed on him, and those ioyned with the true knowledge and feare of God: by which things he being fully perswaded that God was not his enemie, but especially fauorable vnto him, the mā albeit a sinner, yet hauing a good cōscience, did rightly gather, that this change, could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed frō God, as hauing altered his mind; but for what cause soeuer he did it, yet that he was to rest only in his wil, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prouideth for his children, and of whome he hoped neuer to be forsaken. And that this was his resolution, as one not trusting to his owne righteousnes, vvhich neuerthelesse was vnfained, but relying vpon Gods good wil towards him,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:70"/> confirmed by the testimonie of true godlines &amp; charity both invvardly and outwardly; not only these his vvords do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly shevv, but that also doth cleerly prove, that hovvsoeuer he had somvvhat gone out of the vvay, being by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his friends thereunto constrained; yet he brake out into these vvords, chap. 13.15. <hi>though God should slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi> And that is also to be marked, that in both parts of the vers. one &amp; the same word is vsed. For the vvord <hi>(exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere)</hi> in this place doth signifie to receiue willingly and with a cherful mind that vvhich is giuē. For so <hi>Iob</hi> beīg neuer richer in God, then vvhen he vvas most poore in substance, nor euer more strong in mind, then vvhē he vvas in body most feeble, yea and more like a stinking carkasse then a man; so <hi>Iob,</hi> I say, both in vvord &amp; deed declared, vvho, albeit prosperitie much differ frō aduersity, yet still as touching God, he reteined the same indifferencie &amp; moderation of minde. For truly God is one &amp; the same to vs both in vvealth &amp; vvoe, neuer chāging his fatherly good vvill tovvards vs, neuer abusing his rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his children, no not then, vvhen he exerciseth thē vvith most grievous trialls to his ovvne glory; but most liberally crovvning their patience, as the end of this story doth shevv. Yet, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Romane Bishoppe excellently vvriteth, from hence let euery man gather, vvhat paines &amp; torments they are to suffer vvhom God hateth, if here he so chastise them vvhom he loueth: or hovv they shall be punished, vvho in iudgemēt shalbe found guilty, vvhen as their life is so sore afflicted, vvho by the witnes of their iudge are commēded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all this did not Iob sinne with his lips.)</hi> Not to sinne, doeth in this place by a rhetorical mittigation, signifie all one, as so to behaue him selfe as he ought, yea and that before God, so farre as man being regenerate is able to do iustly. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> is not only thus acquited from doing euill, but also is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as one who did vvhat became a true, godly &amp; reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man in all these troubles. For he did not simply refuse, to acknovvledge him selfe a sinner, and call for mercy at his hands, whom he calleth his redeemer, but rightly and iustly denieth him selfe to be an hipocrite as necessarily vvas to be gathered by his vviues speach: albeit afterward, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked by the vniust accusatiōs of his friends, &amp; constrained by the greatnes of his torments, he kept not vvithin cōpas in
<pb facs="tcp:1955:71"/> auouching the sinceritie and vprightnes of his passed life, with the onely testimonie whereof, he comforted him selfe in his miserie; as him selfe acknowledgeth vnto God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Chap. 42.4. and 5. verses. These wordes therefore <hi>(Jn all this)</hi> and <hi>(vvith his lippes)</hi> are opposed to the conference, which followeth in the rest of the Chapters, to the ende of this historie. But the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> doe great iniurie to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and worthie man, who doe so vnderstand this, as if in word he had not sinned, but in minde had trespassed; when contrariwise, it is not to be doubted, but the mind gaue forth to the mouth, whatsoeuer it spake. But who can meruell, that they erred in this thing, who are not ashamed, to condemne <hi>Job</hi> euery where in the exposition of this historie, as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to Gods prouidence? I say therfore on the cōtrary side, that therfore <hi>Iob</hi> offended not in speaking, because he offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not in being silent. And as touching his speach, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the plaine words of this text. And what he thought holding his peace, whēce, but by his speech, may it be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood? But ye will say, why then spake he not him selfe, when he was not prouoked by his wife? as though any more cleare and sounding testimonie of a deuout and peaceable mind to God ward, could be giuen out, then this very silence amidst such calamities, according to that, <hi>I haue held my peace, O Lord, because thou hast done it:</hi> and that: <hi>vvho art thou that ansvvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest God?</hi>

               <p>I Agree to <hi>Mercer,</hi> who thinketh that these three had their names of those, frō whom they tooke their discent: as that <hi>Elephaz</hi> the <hi>Themanite</hi> was so called of <hi>Themā,</hi> the first born of <hi>Elephaz</hi> the sonne of <hi>Esau, Gen.</hi> 36.11: &amp; <hi>Bildad,</hi> of <hi>Suha,</hi> the son
<pb facs="tcp:1955:71"/> of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Ketura, Gen.</hi> 25.1: <hi>Tsophar</hi> of <hi>Tsophus,</hi> which was also one of the sonnes of that forenamed <hi>Eliphaz, Gen.</hi> 36.11. &amp; is here called, for what cause we know not, the <hi>Naamithite:</hi> for these things, are very darke and obscure. But it is cleare, that both cities of their builders, and countries of their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest and chiefest inhabitants, haue taken their names: whereupon often in the Scriptures, mention is made of the region <hi>Theman.</hi> In a word, the thing it selfe doeth euidentlie shew, that these men, as being <hi>Jobs</hi> nearest &amp; dearest friends &amp; familiars, were eyther <hi>Idumeans,</hi> or of the nearest part of <hi>Arabia.</hi> And wheras the <hi>Hebrues</hi> say, that they were so many Kings, that is but confidentlie spoken, as their manner is: yet it is not to be doubted, that they were men of great name &amp; credit, &amp; very famous for that true wisdome, which is defined to be the knowledge of heauenlie and humane thinges, as shall appeare by their speaches. And that they sincerelie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Iob,</hi> and came out of their countries with a louing desire to comfort him, all things declare, which here are set downe: albeit the euent of their purpose, fel out altogither contrary, as who tormented <hi>Iob,</hi> wel nigh as much, as Satan him selfe, but yet of ignorance &amp; vnwittinglie, rather then of ill wil or malice. And although there is no mention of any more then these three, who vpon the knowledge of <hi>Jobs</hi> sudden afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, came to see him: yet it is not to be doubted, sith this thing fell out so vnlooked for, and that the name of <hi>Job</hi> was so renowmed, and his authoritie so great among the people, but that there was great concourse of people to behold this spectacle, whose iudgement were diuers: &amp; yet the greater part detesting him as one hated of God; which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples custome, to determine of the loue or hatred of God towardes any man, by the commodities or discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this life, and especiallie, when such chaunges fall out suddenlie. Againe, great was the vnthankefulnesse of most men, according to that prouerbe before mentioned, <hi>No pennie, no Pater noster.</hi> VVhereof <hi>Job</hi> most pitifullie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth in the Chapters 19.29. and 30. But the historie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of these three by name, both for that they were men of great estimation, as also by reason of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with <hi>Iob,</hi> which is the chiefest and greatest parte of
<pb facs="tcp:1955:72"/> this book. And that these speeches were had in the presence &amp; hearing of others, it appeareth out of the 32. cap. to the 37. where <hi>Elihu,</hi> of whose comming nothing is here spokē, is brought in with a most graue speech, reproouing both <hi>Iob,</hi> as one, who spake out of reason, &amp; these three, as importunate and vnreasonable comforters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A farre off.]</hi> That is, before they came very neare, as the manner of friends is, mutually to imbrace one another, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie when they are afflicted and cast downe: so that hence by any strong reason it cannot be collected, that <hi>Job</hi> beeing cast out of the citie, lay without dores, and vpon a dunghill, as some will, and as the Greeke interpretation hath, which is confuted by <hi>Jobs</hi> owne words. Chap. 7.13.</p>

These things that follow are brought in as tokens of a true compassion and sorrow according to the custome of men in those times, when ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them selues or their friends were fallen into some great miserie; whereof <hi>Mercer</hi> alleadgeth an example out of <hi>Ios.</hi> 7.6. of casting dust vpon the head.</p>

               <p>THat which is here added, hath yet greater force to the witnessing of their true and vnfayned compassion. For those things before mentioned might very easilie haue bene done euen by his enemies. But this seuen dayes continuance with <hi>Job,</hi> beeing in so stinking and filthie a condition, doeth manifestlie prooue, that these men thought nothing lesse, then, that which afterward fell out, so grieuouslie to offende him, and almost to driue him into a blasphemous desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom rather to comfort they desired from their harts. Neither yet is it to be thought, that they staied there so many daies &amp; nights without meat or sleepe, (which is incredible that <hi>Iob</hi> him selfe did) but by this hyperbolicall kind of speech is shewed, their constancie in keeping companie with <hi>Iob;</hi> for so much as they sat at his bed side the greatest part of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies and nights.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:1955:72"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And none spake a word vnto him]</hi> That is, they continued silēt a long time. Where 2. points are necessarily to be cōsidered: 1. what caused them to be silēt so long, who were come for this end, that they might cōfort him both in word &amp; deed: 2. what it was that they tossed in their silēt thoughts, wheras, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they them selues would haue broken off this silence, if <hi>Iob</hi> had not preuented them. Which questions, are not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to knowe howe it came to passe, that <hi>Iobs</hi> so greate constancie was turned into impatiencie, and their preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous comforting turned into a most bitter controuersie: but also are very profitable, that by the errour of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends we may learne a kinde of methode and order in comforting: which if it be not diligentlie vsed, we shalbe so farre from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that, which we desire in comforting our friendes, namely, to ease their miseries: that contrariwise, wee shall bring the most patient men to impatiencie, and at length to meere madnesse: which trulie had happened to this our <hi>Iob,</hi> to the great triumph of Satan, had not <hi>Elihu</hi> first come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, and then God him selfe extraordinarilie appearing, by his power and authoritie ended this controuersie.</p>
               <p>The cause then of this so great silence, is set downe to be this, in that these men sawe <hi>Iobs</hi> griefes wonderfully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: whereby it is sufficientlie vnderstood, that they in the beginning held their peace, not onely for that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished at the straungenes of the thing, but because they thought to wait a while, vntill such time as, his griefe beeing mitigated, he might be the more attentiue to heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their speeches of comfort, as testimonies of their good good will towards him, beeing kept close all the mean while, no otherwise, then if them selues had felt this his misery. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought this their wisdome in exspecting a fit time, nor yet their apparent signification of a true compassion and liuelie feeling of this his calamitie be blamed, but rather commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For as in curing bodilie diseases, great regard is to be had, both to the constitution of the sicke bodie, as also to the changings and course of the disease, by the knowledge of the criticall daies: so in reproouing and giuing comfort, by which we endeauour to cure the diseases of the minde, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances both of time, place and persons, are vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be considered. Neyther truelie doeth the Apostle,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:73"/> willing vs to speake also out of season, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.2. thereby meane to disanull that, which he in another place expressely commaunded, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. and also hath taught vs by his own example, as who was made all things vnto all men: but he condemneth that false shewe of wisdome, which withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs neuer so litle from doing our duetie. Nowe also the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fellowshippe and societie of griefe, doeth greatly ease those, who are in heauinesse, forasmuch as otherwise we may seeme to be forsaken, and to be smally regarded of others in our miseries. Therefore they did not properly sinne in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either the one or the other: notwithstanding herein they trespassed not a little, that in neither they kept a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and moderation. For that is most true, which a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cited out of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> that we ought wisely to foresee, not onely what we doe, but also in what manner we doe it, euen when we doe that which ought to be done of vs, if so be we will attaine to the true ende thereof. For that saying of the heathen Poet is verie notable and worthie to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, although of most men it be smally regarded.</p>
               <p>that is,
<q>
                     <l>Est modus in rebus, sunt certi deni{que} fines,</l>
                     <l>quos vltrà citra{que} nequit consistere rectum.</l>
                     <l>Each thing its limits hath, which it may not exceed,</l>
                     <l>Beyonde, or short of which, can be no perfite deede.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>First of all therefore, is it the part of him who commeth with the intent to comfort others, euen at his first entrance or comming, so to be stroken with the straungenes of that thing, which hath happened, that he is not able to speake one word? But afterward to adde so many testimonies of sorrow or heauines, as if thou shouldest goe about, not so much to ease and comforte thy friend striuing and struggling vvith griefe, as to mourne for him, beeing laid along and readie to giue vp the Ghost, yea as if he were presentlie to be buried; what else could this breede in <hi>Iobs</hi> mind, but an increase and doubling of his sorrowes. For it could not otherwise be, but that beholding that in others, whereof he wanted no sence and feeling in him selfe, all those thinges should the more deepely and throughly be imprinted and settled in his heart. Moreouer for seuen dayes space to sit silent in such an order before a sicke man, what else was it, but to driue <hi>Iob</hi> into des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire?
<pb facs="tcp:1955:73"/> &amp; so long to behold the disease increasing, and more &amp; more grovving, vvithout speaking any word or procuring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for the same, what was it else, but to imitate the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish phisition, who lingereth to applie phisicke, till the sicke mans disease be growen incurable. But if peraduenture they perceiuing this his sickenesse daily to become worse &amp; worse, imagined the same to be mortall, &amp; that it could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be, but that his life would in a verie short time depart from him; why doe they not with all speed and diligence set before his eyes the couenant of eternall life, which is the onely and surest comfort against the terrours of death, and of Gods iudgements? for here it is, as the olde saying goeth, <hi>A wise speach is the phisition of a sicke soule.</hi> What shall we say more? when they saw <hi>Iob</hi> in so great miserie, wherein he was at that present, to testifie his patience and courage, by so qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and peaceable a silence, had it not rather bene their parts to reioyce in this behalfe, that he remained so constant and faithfull to Godward, then with this sorowful habite, &amp; with such pitifull gestures to discourage him, and to weaken the vertue and constancie of his minde? Therefore a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde and wise consideration is to be had in this kind of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, both of the diseases them selues, whether of bodie or minde, as also of the persons which are diseased, that comfort may profitably be applyed, and in season. And this wisedome the holy Spirite of discretion teacheth vs; which forasmuch as it was wanting in these wise men, therefore they lacked little of vndoing their friend, and casting him quite vnder foot, as if they had bene agreed to helpe forward Satans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, whereas notwithstanding they were come together for no other intent but to ease and comfort their friend. And thus much hitherto of the former question &amp; the vse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, suffiseth to haue bene spoken.</p>
               <p>Nowe to come to the other question, what their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was at their first comming to <hi>Iob,</hi> partly their silence, and partly their gesture sheweth: to wit, that they like men astonished were in a muse, casting in their mindes, that it could hardly be, that any true godly and zealous man, such a one as <hi>Iob</hi> was alwayes accounted, should fall into such mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and yet notwithstanding being convicted by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb facs="tcp:1955:74"/> of <hi>Iobs</hi> former life, wherewith they were throughly acquainted, they suspended this their iudgement till such time as seeing his torments more and more to increase, and hearing him at the length breake foorth into such speeches, as might rather beseeme a man desperate and forlorne, then him, who had any, though neuer so little wisedome in him; they were confirmed in that their false and erronious iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For otherwise if they had onely misliked <hi>Jobs</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, which out of doubt came especially through their fault, they would first grauely haue reprooued and stayed the same, so farre as the nature and greatnesse of his griefe might giue them leaue, and straightway haue turned their speach to other matters, counselling him rather to continue in bearing all thinges wisely and patiently as he had begun, and to hope well of Gods goodnesse and mercie towardes him, who neuer forsaketh his children. But they doe farre otherwise, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> beginning, and the other following his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. For they do so iustly reprehend <hi>Iob</hi> for his impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, that here neuerthelesse them selues offende two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes. First, because they do not consider, that them selues by their seuen daies silence, brought <hi>Iob</hi> vnto this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, who before did with wonderfull constancie and moderation beare out his griefe. And againe, they offend not a little, for that they rebuke him more sharply &amp; rigorously, then the extremitie of his passions might well suffer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Iob</hi> afterward, making answere to <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> doth most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously complaine. And yet these things are but small, in comparison of this, that in stead of sweete and comfortable speaches, by which they ought to haue asswaged and mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his griefe, they do in such sort exhort him to call for mercie at Gods handes, as if they had to doe with a most wicked man, and with a notable hypocrite, as with whome God was for that cause highly displeased. Was this to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort a man of a good and vpright conscience, as God him selfe giueth witnesse of him? Was this to maintaine and strengthen him in that patience, which hitherto he had shewed in these his troubles? or was it not rather, to a man already most cruelly afflicted, to adde newe vexations, and those truely so much the more intollerable, by howe much
<pb facs="tcp:1955:74"/> the terrors of conscience, vnto which they laboured to bring <hi>Iob,</hi> are more grieuous then all torments of bodie whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer? Hereunto may be added a most iust indignation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it coulde not be, but <hi>Job</hi> inwardly was throughly gauled, when he heard him selfe to be accounted in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of most wicked and deceitfull hipocrites; so that no man neede marvaile, how he could fall into this impatiencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with so diuers and so forcible engins assayled; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may maruell, howe he could any way temper and moderate him selfe, so that he neither brake foorth into any bitter and reprochfull speaches against those open slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, neither yet reuiled and blasphemed God, as Satan ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to bring to passe by these his temptations. All these things haue I more at large set downe, to the ende we may the better vnderstand the disputation following, as also that we should neither thinke <hi>Job</hi> altogether without fault, nor charge him more hardly then is meete: forasmuch as God taking vp this controuersie, doeth so reprooue <hi>Job,</hi> as that of his louing kindnes and mercie towardes this his seruant, he hideth and couereth his blemishes, yea and layeth almost the whole fault of that wherein <hi>Iob</hi> offended, vpon his three friendes; and lastly crowneth this his champion, as hauing wonne the honor of the combate, with a glorious crowne of victorie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we haue heard how <hi>Iob</hi> did so deceiue all the fierie dartes of Satan, that as yet it seemed he could not be wounded: not that he was without sense or feeling, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them, as the Apostle warneth vs, on the shield of faith and of a good conscience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto was added an especiall feare of God. But nowe let vs heare howe he striueth, not any more with those outward enemies, of whome he was assailed, but with him selfe, and that in such manner, that he was very neere fainting vnder the burthen of his temptation. Neither ought we to marveile at that, since euen in the most holy men there remaineth a strife betwixt the flesh and the Spirite, which is left of God, euen in the Elect (as the Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth by his owne example) to the end, not that we should perish, but partly that we may not triumph before the victorie, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more wished for of Satan: partly that hauing a continuall feeling of our owne weakenesse, we may learne to relye not vpon our owne selues, but vpon God: lastly that by how much the more hard &amp; dangerous the fight hath bene, the victory of godly men may be so much the more glorious. Like as therefore when men fight together with earthly weapons, we doe iudge the one side to be conquerours, not by those things which fall out in the heate of the battaile, the chaunce thereof as yet hanging in doubtfull balance, but by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and issue it selfe: neither is he accounted faint hearted or a coward, which hath bene most grieuously wounded, yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also hath retired, like one overcome, so that afterward he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his strength and his courage againe: so in this spirituall conflict, when as we heare howe Jobs flesh gaue a most furious onset vpon the spirite, we are not therefore to thinke that the spirite, though sometimes it had receiued most perillous woundes, did yet giue ouer the victorie to the flesh: neither are we to condemne Job of suffring impatiency to get the vpper hand, much lesse of blasphemy. For there is great oddes betweene these: neither is he to be deemed properlie
<pb facs="tcp:1955:75"/> vnpatient whosoeuer he be, that being vexed with very great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bodie and minde, such as Job did sustaine in a wonderfull great measure, doth not forthwith resolutely resist them, keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie one and the same course of constancie, but he also is to be termed stout and valiant, in whome the spirit at length getteth the mastery. Therefore most wiselie and fitlie doeth <hi>Iames</hi> warne vs in his <hi>5.</hi> Chap. &amp; <hi>11.</hi> verse, that in thinking vpon this combate of <hi>Iob,</hi> we do not regard that which was done while the combat lasted, but the end of the fight it selfe: wherein God inwardlie strengthened his faithfull seruant, and though he was hardlie layed at, yet did he neuer suffer him to be tempted altogether aboue his strengeh, which he at conuenient times gaue vnto him. And which of the Saints <hi>(I pray you)</hi> hath not had the experience of this, if we will seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consider what thinges haue bene said and done by them? Be it therfore that in Job the flesh did sinne: for he was a man: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (God him selfe being iudge) he was neuer ouercome of the flesh, but, though not without wounds which it receiued in the fight, the spirite in him gate the vpper hand. So Christ, <hi>Ioh. 21.18.</hi> speaking of <hi>Peter</hi> him selfe, whose faith did neuer vtterly faile, <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>thou shalt be olde, thou shalt stretch out thine hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not: signifying by what death he shoulde glorifie God.</hi> For surely in these wordes is declared howe <hi>Peter</hi> did so vndergoe for Christ the paine of martirdome most willingly and constantlie, that neuerthelesse in abiding those paines wherein his spirite reioyced, there was not wanting the flesh for it to striue withall, which was most vnwilling to suffer death. And thus much let it suffice to haue spoken once for all: not for this place alone, but for very many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which we shal meete with hereafter. Now let vs hearken what the flesh here speaketh. <hi>Iob</hi> is grieued, he fretteth, he gnasheth his teeth, he howleth: howe farre would he haue gone, had not the spirit held him backe? surely he would haue runne headlong into blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie &amp; desperation, as Satan hoped it would haue come to passe. And here againe we are prudently to make a difference in this flesh it selfe▪ for in that <hi>Iob</hi> sinneth not, that he being throughly galled with the feeling of so great torments in mind and body, cryeth out (which is naturall for a man to do) but herein he sinneth, in that giuing the raines wholly to his griefe, and as it were setting aside for a time all thinking of God, in which notwithstanding he ought to haue abode,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:76"/> he is caried away without the boundes euen of humane reason. For who would count him in his wits, &amp; not rather frantike, that should bitterly raile vpon his birthday, whether it be that which is past, wherein he was borne, or that which commeth once a yere? &amp; yet we see that the same or worse happened to <hi>Ieremy,</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi> v. <hi>14.</hi> and many of <hi>Dauids</hi> complaintes in the Psalmes are not farre behinde. See then how farre the violent &amp; outragious affections of our mind will soone carie vs, which the philosophers would haue vs to rule by reason, this remedy truely of theirs being not altogether vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but yet not of fufficient force, euen in the least temptations: which the spirit of God alone lightning our vnderstanding, doeth minister to vs in our distresse. There is no man therefore without sinne: but they sinne one way in whom wickednesse doth absolutely raigne, or who wholly and wilfully giue ouer them selues to commit sinne: and they another, who do so sinne, that the spirit yet cryeth in them, howe that they do according to the flesh, that whith they would not do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the spirit: whereof <hi>Iob</hi> affordeth vs a notable exāple in this place &amp; hereafter. For who can choose but wonder, that he in so great vnquietnes of his mind, did not so much as cast out one word, either against his wife, or against his friēds, that delt so vnwisely with him, or against any other as mē do, being out of patiēce or rather mad? And that (as appeareth by the <hi>20.</hi> vers.) so sone as God came into his mind, the flesh was thereby, though not altogether, yet so farre daūted that it kept it selfe with in the compasse of weeping &amp; wailing. For whereas the Hebrue interpreters thinke very hardly of <hi>Iob,</hi> some of them counting him a calculator of his natiuitie, as though he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted these his calamities not to Gods prouidence, but to some aspect of malignant starres, &amp; therefore cursed his birthday, other some in plaine termes calling him wicked &amp; blasphemous, I shall not need to spend many words in refuting them, since herafter they are disproued by the sentēce of God himself, as it were iudging &amp; determining the whole matter, who findeth fault with Iobs speeches for being vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yea &amp; sometimes ranging beyond the precinct of godlines, yet so that acquiting him from all grosse sinne and wickednes, he crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him with the garland of a famous victorie.</p>
                  <p>There remaine many thinges for vs to examine in this Chapter, and first of all this question may not vnfitly be mooued in this place, whether we ought so to repose our selues whollie in Gods wil, in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring patiently what thinges soeuer, that we can not without sinne wish, that those things which are done alreadie, were either vndone,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:76"/> or done otherwise. J answer, that such wishes simply are so farre from being sinnes, that contrariwise we do sometimes heinously sinne, if we wish not with our harts that very many things done by vs or by others, had neuer bene done, though now they can not be vndone againe. For hereunto belongeth the true repentance of thē, who condemne their life that is passed: &amp; therfore God him selfe bewailing, after the mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, the stubbornes of vnthankfull Israel, after they had bene punished, crieth out. <hi>Psal. 81.14. O that my people had harkened vnto me, that Israel had walked in my waies.</hi> Nowe by these words, which are attributed to God him selfe, we may easilie cōceiue in what respect, we hauing before our eyes the wisdome of God him selfe in gouerning this vniuersall worlde, may without offence wish that some thing had fallen out otherwise, and that is this, in regarde that those things displease vs, whereby he is prouoked to execute his iust &amp; seuere iudgement; so notwithstanding, that we willingly hold our selues content with that, which wee see pleaseth him, euen then, when not onely wee doe not see the reason of his doeings, and of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents which folow thereupon, but also when the Lord seemeth to our brainsick wisdom to do somthing which they that as it were cite him to appeare before the iudgemēt seat of their own reason, would iudge to be cleane contrarie to his nature. They, therfore principally offend in such like wishes, who vnto the consideration of Gods gouernment in ordering the world both generally, &amp; especially in this or that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of matters, bring preiudicate opinions, fetched frō the storehouse of humane arrogancie: vpon occasiō wherof they rashly prye into gods iudgements, &amp; not finding that which satisfieth them from such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane boldnes they run headlong into open impiety. Examples hereof are rise in all sorts of writings of worldly wise men, of whome <hi>Paul</hi> truly writeth, that they became vaine in their imaginations? And from no other head for the most part haue risen, &amp; daily do rise wil-worships &amp; heresies, wherby the Church ceaseth not to be exercised, then from this, that men, not onely beeing openly curious &amp; ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but also deceiuing them selues with a counterfeit shew of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout conscience, do measure al things by their owne braine, &amp; shew their outragious boldnes no lesse in establishing their owne dreames, thē in impugning whatsoeuer they mislike, not sparing god himselfe. But they are not to be reckoned amōg these, who not vpon a prophane curiosity, neither bringing with thē selues preiudicate opinions, if they light vpon any thing in the daily workes of God which belongeth to their vocation for them to knowe, the causes whereof they knowe
<pb facs="tcp:1955:77"/> not, so that this their ignorance holdeth their mindes in suspence, being mooued with a deuout affection, in these thoughtes of theirs, first to aske counsell at the word of God, whereby they may haue a generall direction in discerning such matters: then, that by the true knowledge of those generall heades out of Gods worde, they may rightly in the feare of God determine such particular cases as they meete withall, and vnderstand what they are to doe herein, if it be about them selues, they search their owne consciences: but if the question be about other men, they doe carefullie and without respect of persons search out the causes from whence that proceeded, about which the doubt is mooued. But if they can not yet find that which will satisfie them, yet this ground they alwayes holde, that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God is vnblameable &amp; irreprooueable, whose will, whether it be manifested to vs or hid from vs, we are to honour without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Besides in present miseries, whether they be our owne or other mens, either publike or priuate, we haue libertie also to bewaile our estate, to lament, and, to make short, to powre out our griefes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bosome, and to beseech God that he would rid vs from them: but these exceptions being obserued, that our complaints arise, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the dastardlinesse of our courage, nor from any prophane affection, nor as though we would striue with God: but that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bring with vs a minde, readie to beare patiently whatsoeuer shalbe laid vpon vs. And because it would require a large treatise to set foorth this doctrine by many examples, let it suffice vs for this time to lay this matter open to our view in this one example of <hi>Iob. IOB</hi> the most righteous man liuing, becommeth on the sudden of all other the most miserable: and yet not onely humane reason but also the very nature of the most righteous God seemeth necessarily to require, that good things should be giuen to good men, euill things to euil men. This foundation then being laid, whosoeuer they be that looke vpon <hi>Iob</hi> in this most miserable estate, they conclude that it must needes be (or else God should not deale iustly) that there was at that time no man liuing more wicked then <hi>Iob,</hi> who notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding went alwayes for a most holy and iust man. Hereupon it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that he is reprooued of all that are about him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some, of whome <hi>Iob</hi> euery where complaineth, doe reuile him, as being a most damnable man: others being more indifferent, as his wife and those thre friendes of his, are out of hope of his life, but not of his saluation: and when they see him making no mention of his
<pb facs="tcp:1955:77"/> sinnes, do nothing else then make protestation of his vpright consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they labour earnestly in this, that bringing him from this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his owne innocencie, they may draw him to condemne his former life, and with the detestation of his notable hypocrisie to aske God mercie, which was the onely way that was left him to procure his deliuerance. But <hi>Iob</hi> making answere, though he acknowledge himselfe to be a man, and so a sinner, yet hauing the testimonie of a good conscience that there was no cause on his part, why God should deale so hardly with him aboue other men, ceaseth not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning howsoeuer the foolish reason of man gainsayeth it, mildely &amp; quietly to praise God, as being iust. Yet at the length his tormēts being wonderfully increased, and being grieued to the heart at the seuen dayes silence of his friendes, as though he were from thence foorth to looke for no helpe at Gods hands; moreouer euen then tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in his minde how it might be that God should so punish him aboue other men: and yet for all that no not then conceiuing any sinister opinion of God, he breaketh out into these terrible cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
                  <p>But before we heare <hi>Iob</hi> powring out his grievous complaints &amp; making his most pitifull lamentation, the place it selfe seemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that first we speake somewhat of that question, namely, howe farre and in what respectes a man may lawfullie wish rather to die then to liue. For hereby we shall perceiue how farre Iob was faultie in this point, and wherein he transgressed. The vse and fruition of this life is doubtlesse the great gift and blessing of God, which to neglect or make no account of, it were madnesse. Contrariwise death, as it commeth from sinne, so is it also an enemie to nature, and seemeth not without good cause to be feared, forasmuch as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse godly men, and among others <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ezechias</hi> haue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly prayed against it, and Christ him selfe being free from the least blemish of sinne, was thereof marueilously afraid. Notwithstanding if this should simply and without exception take place, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that nothing were so long as we liue, more to be desired of vs then this life, nothing more to be feared then death. But this can in no wise be. The whole true Church which is as it were a meere straunger in this worlde, and which thirsteth after that better life, yea and so liueth heere vpon earth, as if alreadie its conversation were in heauen, plainely sheweth the contrarie. And againe if it were so, it woulde take away the atchieving of many excellent
<pb facs="tcp:1955:78"/> thinges, which can not be enterprised without a resolute minde, not caring for death. That therefore which we haue sayde is true, if it be referred to the originall of life and death, But besides their originall condition, two thinges haue since as an overplus bene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which are here to be obserued. For through sinne it is come to passe, that this life is of all thinges become most wretched and miserable, which the first death shortly after succeeding, graunteth as it were a certaine truce vnto the bodie for a time, namelie, a freedome from griefe, whereof notwithstanding the bodie it selfe hath no feeling; but the soule it by and by sendeth to horrible paines and tormentes vntill such time as the seconde death adiudge both the one and the other to eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This is the state of all men in generall, except onely those, vpon whome God hath decreed to shewe mercie through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnesse in Christ our Sauiour. And yet these also are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the calamities of this present life, and taste them as well as others: but it is for their good and profite, whether by this meanes it please God to chastize them with his fatherly rodde, or else to exercise and trayne them vp, partly that they bee wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the thinges of this worlde, and partely that his vertue and power may be seene in their infirmitie, who in the ende crowneth his victorious champions with eternall happinesse. Moreouer they abide vnder the same necessitie of the first death, which shall befall them, when and in what manner it shall seeme good to Gods heauenly wisedome. Neither yet proceedeth this from GOD, as beeing any way angrie or displeased, but rather beeing verie tenderlie and louingly affected towardes them: for their soule is foorthwith taken into the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euerlasting blessednesse. The bodie, although it lye in the earth dead and rotten, yet it is not deliuered to death to bee destroyed of it, but rather (which is vtterly against the nature of death) to be safely kept till the latter day, and then death it selfe shall be wholly swallowed vp of most blessed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. These thinges standing thus, which are confirmed by most certen and expresse groundes out of Gods worde, and also by the testimonie of this our <hi>IOB,</hi> it must needes followe that the state of the wicked is both in life and in death most miserable, and yet of both, death is rather to be wished then life. For by howe much the longer time they liue, and in
<pb facs="tcp:1955:78"/> greater aboundance enioye the goods and pleasures of this worlde, by so much the more grievous shall their punishment be, either in this life or in the life to come, or in both: and surely this benefite at the least they reape by the first death, that for a time their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are free from all sence and feeling of griefe. Moreouer Christ him selfe witnesseth that it had bene better for them, neuer to haue bene borne: howe so euer some reason more subtillie then sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is better to be miserable, then not to bee at all. Nowe whereas we see that it falleth out farre otherwise, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked account this life to be most happie and pretious, we ought to ascribe it to their owne madnesse, in that beeing bewitched with the pleasures of this life, they thinke not at all what shall become of them hereafter, and therefore we may beholde howe some of them both liue and dye like beastes: others, when any grievous calamitie befalleth them, breake foorth into pitifull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations and bootelesse outcryes, and are most vnwilling to forgoe this life: others, either beeing ouercomme with greatnesse of griefe, or strooken with a terrour of conscience through the sence and loathsomnesse of their sinnes, fall into desperation, and runne headlong into the same death, which otherwise they are so much afraide of. For they falsely imagine, that by ending this life, they shall ende all their troubles and miseries. Contrariwise both this life and death also it selfe is sweete &amp; welcome to them, whose mindes are enlightened with the true knowledge of God, and whome God so gouerneth with his holy Spirite in this life, that they are neither puffed vp with prosperitie, nor discouraged with aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. And looke at what time, and by whatsoeuer meanes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to take them out of this worlde, he so whollie filleth their soules with a most certaine hope of blessed immortalitie, whereof they shall immediately be made partakers, that they are no lesse ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the houre of death, then the day labouring man, when he seeth the sunne go downe, knowing the time approcheth, in which he shall receiue his wages, and goe rest him at home in his owne house: or he who hauing with great trauell and daunger a long time wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered abroade, (as the Poet <hi>Homer</hi> faigned of his <hi>Vlysses</hi> not vnwisely, albeit to another purpose) doeth at the length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde a farre off the smoke of his owne chimney, beeing from thence foorth to take his wished ease, and to rest from all his trauaile. Therefore as J haue saide▪ to the godlie neither life nor
<pb facs="tcp:1955:79"/> death is amisse: and yet death is more beneficiall to them then life, and rather to be desired, not because they are wearie of the troubles and discommodities of this life, (albeit euen in this respect it be in it selfe no sinne at all, moderately to beseech God, to take vs out of this life if it be his good pleasure) nor yet because they directlie seeke their owne good and profit (for this were not to loue God for him selfe, but rather for our owne sakes; which thing we will not allow of in our friendes) but partlie, that they may once for all, whollie be set free from so miserable bondage of sinne, as the Apostle teacheth vs by his owne example, <hi>Rom. 7.24.</hi> partlie also that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him as it were face to face, yea and more rightlie serue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, whom all their life time they haue most earnestlie sought, treading in the steps of the same Apostle, <hi>Phil 1.23.</hi> These things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, it remaineth now, to propound &amp; declare certaine contrary examples, and then consequentlie shew wherein and how farre this desire of death in <hi>Iob</hi> passed measure, and wherin it was to be misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Therefore as touching the example of <hi>David, Psal. 6.6</hi> and <hi>30.10.</hi> and <hi>115.17.</hi> as also of <hi>Ezechias, Esa. 38.19.</hi> if any man will dilligentlie consider in what state they were when as they desired God not to take their liues from them, he shall finde that they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be deliuered, not so much from bodilie death, as from the wrath and anger of God, whome at that time they knew and also felt to to be angrie and displeased with them for their sinnes. For what J pray you can be more feareful then death, being ioyned with the anger of God? moreouer it is manifest out of the places before alleadged, that the zeale of setting forth Gods glory in his Church caused them to pray in that manner, yea they were inflamed with such an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of profiting the Church of God, in so needefull a time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dueties of their calling, that in this respect, they were willing for a time to prolong the attaining and the fruition of their owne saluation. For otherwise what could they haue rather wished then forthwith and out of hand to be receiued into that heauenlie citie, which their whole desire was to come vnto? <hi>Hebr. 11.16.</hi> and therefore <hi>Elias</hi> thinking that the whole Church of Jsrael was come to nought, and that he alone was left, is so farre from being vnwilling to die, that he desireth nothing more, thinking verilie, that now there was not any place &amp; abiding for him here vpō earth. Neither yet did he thus for that he hated, and was simplie wearie of this life, but because he could not abide to liue any longer amongst the prophane
<pb facs="tcp:1955:79"/> contemners of God, <hi>1. King. 19.18.</hi> Concerning <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi> I shall speake afterward. Now as touching that most horrible agonie of Christ, there is a speciall and peculiar reason, which is againe and againe to be considered. Doubtlesse Christ by his most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayer, which he made to his father, to remooue from him that cuppe, meaning the death which he was to suffer, shewed not him selfe vnwilling to die, (for who could haue compelled him beeing vnwilling? and also how could it be true, that we are saued by his obedience vnto the death, euen to the death of the crosse?) but while the Godhead in him rested and was still, as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> not vnfitlie speaketh, and while al his humane senses, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer free from sinne and corruption, were whollie occupied in the horrible iudgement of God his father, which he was euen presently to sustaine, he brake forth into that petition, <hi>Matth. 26.39. O my father, if it be possible let this cuppe passe from me.</hi> For he was not simplie afraid of death, beeing the most perfite and absolute patterne of all true fortitude, but in his flesh he greatlie feared to vndergoe that curse, from which he could neuer haue safely escaped, and much lesse haue deliuered vs, if he had beene a meere man, yea though he had come in the nature of an Angell. Therefore he feared for a time that heauie and vntollerable burden, to the end we might not any longer feare death, which he hath so throughlie vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that neither we seeke for life, nor yet can possiblie finde it any where else, then in that his most pretious death. Now J suppose it is time to come to <hi>Iob</hi> him selfe, whome we can not denie, in this his desire of death, diuers wayes to haue offended; yet in this pointe his fall was not extraordinarie, but such as is incident to humane frailtie. For those speeches which he vseth, doe not proceede from a resolute and setled iudgement, but are in a manner constrained, through the greatnes of his griefe, obscuring for a time the light of his faith and vnderstanding. For whereas he perswadeth him selfe, that he can not otherwise be deliuered out of those troubles, but by death; it argueth that he did not sufficientlie waigh the infinitenes of Gods power: whereas he wisheth that eyther he had neuer beene borne, or else had presentlie dyed as soone as he came out of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, he playeth the part of a very vnconsiderate man, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting so many benefits which he had receiued, yea forgetting him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elfe, and that excellent wise speech which he vsed in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Shall we receiue good at the handes of God, and shall
<pb facs="tcp:1955:80"/> we not receiue euill?</hi> Whereas he desireth to be deliuered from all these miseries, and yet doeth not in this behalfe powre out his prayers vnto God, it sheweth that his minde was altogither trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and disquieted within him: whereas in all these wishes which he maketh, he hath respect onely of his owne ease and quietnesse, which he thinketh to finde in death, vnlesse, as we shall heare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Iobs</hi> owne words weare to the contrarie, he might seeme to be one of the number of them, who looke onely vnto this life, or not much to differ from the sect of Epicures, who imagine that nothing remaineth after death, but that the soule and bodie perish togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Notwithstanding as I said before, all these things were onely tokens of mans weakenes and infirmitie, as <hi>Iob</hi> him selfe in the end acknowledgeth. Nowe if <hi>Iob</hi> so worthie and so excellent a man fell in this sort, through the frailtie of his nature; how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie and earnestlie ought we, who are farre from that perfection which was in <hi>Iob,</hi> to beseech God night and day not to leade vs into temptation, not to giue us ouer to our owne lusts, nor at any time vtterlie to leaue and forsake vs? Last of all, as touching the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> albeit he vseth few wordes; yet, he may seeme to speake more vehementlie and in greater vexation of spirite then <hi>Iob</hi> here doeth, if their speeches be compared togither. But herein there is a very great difference, in that <hi>Iob</hi> dealeth onely for him selfe &amp; his own cause, wheras <hi>Ieremie</hi> could not abide that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God should in his ministerie be contemned, and in this respect he complaineth out of measure, and doeth as it were expostulate and reason the matter with God. The same also happened to <hi>Ionas,</hi> who cared not so much for his own estimation &amp; credit, as he feared least the authoritie of Gods truth and that his Prophetical function should be called in question. As therefore both of them are greatlie to be commended for their zeale in promoting Gods glorie, so here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are iustlie to be reprooued, that, whereas, it ought to haue beene sufficient for them faithfullie discharging their dueties to leaue the successe to God, they proceed so farre beyond their bounds, as if they could better tell what concerned Gods glorie, then God him selfe. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> also offended, whome <hi>Christ</hi> rebuketh in such manner, as that he seemeth not towards any to haue vsed a more sharp and bitter reproofe, bidding him goe from him, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him by the name of Satan: So hard a thing is it not onely to auoid that which of its owne nature is euil, but also to beware that
<pb facs="tcp:1955:80"/> we doe not grieuouslie offend through a preposterous &amp; inordinate desire of doeing well: which thing if it had beene well and iustly obserued by many in these times, otherwise very godly and learned men, neither the sinceritie of religion had beene thus miserablie corrupted, nor the face of the Church whollie deformed.</p>

                  <head>¶ THE SVMME AND ORDER of the 4. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>HItherto we haue seene, how <hi>Iobs</hi> friends by their vnreasonable silence, beeing nothing at all availeable to ease and asswage <hi>Iobs</hi> griefes, prouoked him to impatiencie, as hath appeared in the former Chapter, and as <hi>Iob</hi> him selfe afterward witnesseth, Chap. <hi>6.21.</hi> Now wee shall heare how <hi>Eliphaz</hi> layeth the foundation of that waightie controuersie and disputation that followeth: how he doth not reprooue <hi>Iobs</hi> immoderate complaints in such order as he ought, but thereby very vnwiselie taketh an occasion thoroughly to sting him: so that by his meanes and the other two, which tooke part with him in his accusation, <hi>Iob,</hi> beeing ouercharged with their most false and slanderous allegations, was very neere driuen into desperation. Notwithstanding J confesse, that this was not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpose. Yea rather on the contrarie part, they supposed that this was the onely way to helpe and redresse all his miseries, if they might bring him to the acknowledgement of his sinnes, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of his life passed, and humblie to craue mercie and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at Gods handes. But forasmuch as they tooke a wrong course, and stoode vpon a false ground, it is no merueile, though they had well neere cast him away, whome especiallie they desired to saue. Therefore that saying of <hi>Terence</hi> is not alwaies true, <hi>Wee that are well, can giue good aduise to those that are sicke.</hi> For (as wee see in this dolefull example) it is not enough for vs, when we will comfort others, to bring a good and louing minde, nor in some generall tearmes to aduertise them aright, vnlesse more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer we obserue these two things: First, that (as expert phisitions vse to doe in diseases of the bodie) we labour to know the true and certen
<pb facs="tcp:1955:83"/> cause of the diseases of the minde, not by any hastie and vntimelie iudgement, not by euery false and lying coniecture, not by common, but by proper and vnfallible signes. Secondly, that when once we haue found out the truth and certentie of the disease, we haue such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as neere as we may, both to the person diseased, and to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of time and place, that we temper sweet and sowre togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with discretion so mixe our vineger with sugar, and our sugar with vineger, that if we chaunce to doe him no good, the fault may lye whollie vpon the patient him selfe, and not vpon the phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore concerning the two first points, <hi>Iobs</hi> friendes are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be commended then otherwise, who without any delayes came vnto him, in this his great extremity, therby shewing that they loued him vnfainedly: &amp; they reasoned many things very wiselie &amp; in a manner diuinely, concerning the acknowledging of our sinnes, and vnfained repentance, concerning Gods wisedome, his power, his fearefull iudgements against wicked and obstinate persons, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercie towards the humble and penitent. But in the two latter, namely in making application to the person of <hi>Iob,</hi> they were most foulie deceiued, as, by the oration of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> in these two chapters may thus be made manifest.</p>
                  <p>The first verse of this fourth Chapter, beeing the entrance or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his speach, is full of bitternes, and therefore not agreeing with <hi>Iobs</hi> person, nor with that time. For those immoderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Iob</hi> being so farre out of square, were most iustly to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but yet rather with compassion, then with indignation.</p>
                  <p>Jn the <hi>3, 4, 5, 6.</hi> verses, he reasoneth with <hi>Iob</hi> after this manner: when others were in aduersity, thou wast wont to comfort them, and hereby thou gottest no smal commendation of godlines. But now thou art not onely to seeke of those comforts, which then thou didst yeald vnto others, but thou art altogither discouraged and out of harte. Therefore I perceiue thy godlinesse was but counterfeit: it is now manifest that in seruing God, thou hadst respect rather to thine own commoditie, then to God him selfe and his glorie. This is a false kind of reasoning, <hi>à non causa, vt causa,</hi> from that which was not the cause, as if it had beene the true cause. For that which proceedeth from the bitternes of his griefe, he so taketh, as if it had come from a hart full of wickednes and vngodlinesse.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>7.</hi> verse, God (saith he) neuer forsaketh those that are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, be neuer destroyeth the innocent and vpright man. But <hi>Iob</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:1955:83"/> cryeth out and complayneth, that he is forsaken, and we see it with our eyes: therefore <hi>Iobs</hi> holinesse and integritie of life was but feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hypocriticall. The assumption or minor of this argument is false, for it was not Gods purpose in afflicting <hi>Iob,</hi> to cast him off, or to destroy him, but rather in this his seruant to tryumph ouer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: so that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> shoulde rather haue reasoned thus: God neuer destroyeth true, godlie, virtuous, iust and vpright men: But the whol course of <hi>Iobs</hi> former life doth giue vs sufficient proofe, that he is such a one: therefore <hi>Iob</hi> hath no cause to faint, or be discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: neyther hath he powred forth these complaintes with any setled and resolute iudgement, but as one disquieted and ouercharged with the burden of his afflictions: therefore we ought to rayse him vp, and to comfort him.</p>
                  <p>Jn the <hi>8. 9</hi> and <hi>10.</hi> verses he reasoneth thus. Looke what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and proportion there is betweene, that which is sowed and that which is reaped, the same agreement is betweene the life of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, &amp; Gods iudgment, by which he blesseth the godly, &amp; bringeth the wicked to their deserued destruction. Now who seeth not, that God dealeth nootherwise with <hi>Iob,</hi> thē he vseth to do with most vile and wicked men? therefore doubtles we haue bin deceiued in him, he is not the man we tooke him for: but as of all men he is now most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, so is he a most prophane and vngodly person. But this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is also false and vtterly to be reiected, which maketh the only cause of all troubles and grieuances, which befall men in this life, to be no other, but the sinnes of men, together with Gods hatred and displeasure conceiued against them for the same. For seeing these miseries are common to all sortes of men, whether they bee good or bad, yea, and it so falleth out for the most parte, that the better and more vertuous men are, the greater and more grieuous afflictions they suffer in this life, and that sometimes also, to their verie dying day, as experience daylie teacheth: it must needs follow that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> is most false: and that it is most true which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> speaketh, that no man can rightly determine of Gods loue or hatred towardes him, by prosperitie or by aduersitie.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>11</hi> verse vnto the ende of the Chapter, he bringeth forth a certaine vision, which he had from heauen: but it maketh nothing against <hi>Iob.</hi> For thereout this may and also ought to be gathered, that man is nothing, if he be compared with God: and that God can finde enough in euery one, both to dislike and to punish in him.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:84"/> But the question at this time was not concerning this point, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching these controversies, namely, whether God doeth not lay afflictions vpon any man for his sinnes: and, whether we ought to iudge of euery mans life and behauiour, by the greatnesse of those troubles and miseries which he doeth suffer. And therefore <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi> doeth here after a sort play the sophister, quite chaunging the state of the question.</p>

                  <p>NOW in this Chapter to the ende of the seventh verse, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the Saintes to witnesse with him against <hi>Iob:</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes charging <hi>Iob</hi> vniustly, he goeth about to proove by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, that God dealeth with him in such manner, as he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to doe with the wicked, whome he abhorreth, and whome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse he suffereth to flourish and growe vp for a time, to the ende their fall may afterwarde be the greater, and more grievous. But what is this to <hi>Iob?</hi> For if he woulde haue that reason and conclusion to take place against <hi>Iob,</hi> he ought first to haue prooued, that whose wretched estate is all one, their life also &amp; behauior hath bin like: &amp; yet this also is false as well as the other. For we can not, neither may we iudge all one of Gods loue or hatred towardes those who haue both liued alike, and also bene partakers of the same or the like miseries. The contrarie is daily shewed by infinite examples, but especiallie of the two theeues, both of them for their misdeedes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining the like punishment vpon the Crosse, and yet the one of them thorowe the mercie of God, by the crosse ascended into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall blessednesse, the other by the iust iudgement of Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the crosse into euerlasting destruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliphaz</hi> hauing set downe these thinges, concludeth that the onely meanes for <hi>Iob</hi> to procure Gods fauour and his owne salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, namely, that leauing off these fruitlesse lamentations, he would in time bethinke him of repentaunce, which might be aunswerable to the number and greatnesse of his sinnes: forasmuch as the wicked doe but in vaine, and to their owne destruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliously
<pb facs="tcp:1955:84"/> striue against the great power of God, who is a most iust and righteous iudge: And againe on the contrarie side, that the mercie of God is exceeding great towardes penitent sinners, which may raise them vp, though they be neuer so much cast downe: Therefore that <hi>Iob</hi> shoulde soone finde this to be true, and haue experience thereof in him selfe, if he will at the length be wise and followe good counsell. All which thinges are verie truelie wisely, and religiously spoken, notwithstanding they are, as also the former were, altogether vnfittely applyed to the person of <hi>Iob.</hi>

                  <p n="19">19. And I pray thee, O God, when wilt thou, after all this while, holde thy hand from striking me, at the least, so long time, till I may, poore miserable wretch that I am, but euen swallow downe my spettle?</p>

                  <p>Loe, I confesse and acknowledge my selfe to bee a sinner: What am I able to doe with thee? O thou that art so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ouer mans saluation, and to whome the life of thy saints is so deare and precious, why hast thou set mee against thee as a marke to shoote at? and why am I so burdensome vnto thee, that thou canst not beare and suffer me any longer?</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>And why doest not thou take away my transgression, and remoue from me mine iniquitie? For now shall I sleepe in the dust, and if thou seekest me betimes in the morning, J shall not be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alas, why doest thou not rather put away all mine offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make an ende of these thy corrections? For, by the grieuousnesse of this affliction, I am brought to such extremitie, that out of hande I shall lye in the dust: and albeit thou vse great diligence in seeking mee out, yet shalt thou not finde me: because henceforth, I shall not be a man any longer.</p>

                     <hi>BIldad</hi> followeth the steppes of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> but he reuileth <hi>Iob</hi> more vnfriendlie, and vseth greater bitternesse of speech: so farre is he from amending that, wherein the other had exceeded measure, albeit otherwise in the thing it selfe, he had not offended. Therefore in the <hi>2.</hi> verse, he most bitterlie findeth fault both with <hi>Iobs</hi> speech and gesture. And in the <hi>3.</hi> verse, he wresteth in a most true position, but yet such a one, as very little concerned this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent disputation against <hi>Iob:</hi> and he doeth it with as small wisdome &amp; discretion, as with great pride and confidence. For doth it either argue <hi>Iob</hi> an hypocrite &amp; wicked man, or charge God with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, if it be said that <hi>Iob</hi> for his sinnes was not so afflicted by God, (whereas he in the meane time denieth not him selfe to be a sinner, and to haue deserued Gods heauy hand vpon him) but rather proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; tried by him according to his good pleasure. Yet <hi>Bildad</hi> goeth on as if he had done very well, and in the <hi>3.</hi> verse, in plaine wordes boldly auoucheth, that <hi>Iobs</hi> children were by Gods iust iudgement destroied with the fall of the house. For by this meanes he thought he might bring <hi>Iob</hi> into some hope of appeasing Gods wrath (for that he had not suddenly slaine him as he had done them) and therefore in the <hi>5.6.7.</hi> verses hee assureth him, as Eliphaz did before, that all things shall go well with him, if he repent. Then generallie he reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the transitorie felicitie of the wicked and of the sure and permanent happines of the righteous, by verie goodly similitudes; to the wicked verie fitlie but nothing at all agreeing to Job: and this he doth from the <hi>6.</hi> verse to the end of the <hi>19.</hi> all which he applieth plainlie vnto Iob, verse <hi>20. and 21.26.</hi>

                  <p>ELiphaz had accused Iobs life, as being full of feigned holinesse and vprightnesse, and had exhorted him to repentance, which might bee answerable to so great an offence, vsing an argument drawne from the nature of God, which can not abide to deale so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifullie with a true, godlie, and virtuous man: as Bildad did likewise complaine, treading in the same steppes, or rather, going somewhat further, and did in flat termes finde fault with Iob and his children, as it were casting in his teeth their sudden destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now Iob answearing for himselfe, doth not onely acknowledge the infinite power of God, and his iustice, beeing greater then that any exception can bee taken against it, and that in a more plaine, excellent, and diuine manner, then either Eliphaz or Bildad had done before him: but also returneth the verie same argument, which was brought against him vpon his aduersaries: rightly, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and religiouslie denying that consequence, which they had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For in the eleuen first verses he sheweth that this power and iustice of God which daily offereth it selfe to our view in his works is so great and infinite, that the reason thereof can not he conceyved by man: forasmuch as he fetcheth not the causes of his decrees and purposes from the things which he gouerneth: but his will which is before all things is the rule of all iustice, which he teacheth vers. <hi>12.</hi> &amp; <hi>15.</hi> And Paule had respect vnto this, rising a great deale higher, namely to the eternall decree of Election and Reprobation, Rom. <hi>9.20</hi> &amp; <hi>11.32.</hi> Afterward to the end of the <hi>21.</hi> verse, he doth verie wisely applie this doctrine to himselfe, flatlie denying, how hardlie soeuer he were delt withall, that euer it came into his mind, either to charge God with any iniustice, or foolishly in his sight to auouch himselfe to be free from all sinne so notwithstanding, that deeming of him selfe according to his present sicknes and affliction, he denieth that there is any hope for him of recouering this life. Hereby wee may easilie perceiue, how vaine and friuolous their iudgements are on both parts, who determine of these matters according to the reach of mans braine. For Jobs friends hope, that which was indeed to
<pb facs="tcp:1955:96"/> come to passe as the euent prooued, that Iob though he were brought to the last cast, neuerthelesse should be restored againe, euen to a far better estate then euer before he had inioyed: but of the way how he should be restored, therein they iudged amisse. Job on the contrarie side doth altogether dispaire of his recouerie, and wisheth to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from his afflictions by death: falsely deeming by the greatnes of his miserie that God had so determined: Then returning to the generall position, he sheweth that that was not true, which his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries had set down concerning the sudden destruction of the wicked and the constant prosperitie of the godlie: which he proueth first in generall vers. <hi>22.23.24.</hi> and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n propounding his owne example vers. <hi>25.26.27.28.</hi> He farther answeareth from the <hi>29.</hi> verse to the end of the chapter, that he can not allow of their iudgement in this point, that he should euer by any meanes obtaine to be restored vnto his former estate and much lesse into better: because all hope of this thing is cleane taken from him. And last of all trusting vpon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of his innocent conscience, hee appealeth vnto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and (setting apart that maiestie of God, before which none is able to stand) is readie to plead his cause against them, euen before God who is moste iust. But as touching the names of those starres, which are mentioned vers. <hi>9.</hi> I am of their iudgement who thinke that the <hi>4.</hi> quarters of the yeare are signified thereby, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologians teach to bee gouerned by the influences as they terme them, of certaine starres. Therefore the learned interpretours haue not vnfitly translated, <hi>Has, Arcturus, Chasil, Orion: Chimah, Pliades,</hi> or the seuen starres: and the Climates of the south, the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer signes: altogether neglecting the toies of the vnlearned <hi>Rabins:</hi> whith starres or signes are answerable to Autume and winter, the spring time and summer. But I had rather retaine still the Hebrue words, then vse the other, which haue bene so much abused with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and impure tales &amp; deuices of the wicked and prophane poets.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. 2. BVt thereunto Iob answered in these words. Harkē my frends whether you do rightly condemne me, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and as an hipocrite. I yeld vnto you, when as you affirme Gods iustice to be very great and without end: yea Eliphaz I graunt somwhat more then I could heare or learne of you, when as you said before (4. Chap. vers. 3.) that man could not bee more iust then God. For I say farther, that none euer could be found so iust, that he might any way be compared vnto God. 3. And this likewise I graunt to you Bildad, that nothing can be done of God either against his iustice or against his power: so that I may without controlment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thus much, that if anie be so madde that he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him about his iudgements, he coulde not though he were neuer so wise answere him one obiection of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. 4. For God is such a one who neither wanteth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdome to decree, nor incomprehensible power to bring to passe: neither shall any man euer rebelliously resist either his most powerfull iustice, or his most iust power, but that he shall be punished most seuerely.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee remooueth mountaines, and it is not knowne when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth them in his wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>He maketh the earth to goe out of her place: and the pillars thereof to tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>He speaketh to the Sunne and it ariseth not, and sealeth vp the starres.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. For who is able to withstand his power? or who is able to compare with him in strength, who with such violēce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueth huge mountaines, that being thorough his furie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:97"/> they appeare not any where, neyther can they any more be seene? 6 At whose commaundement the earth is mooued out of her place, yea the very pillers and foundations thereof are shaken. 7 It is he who hath made the Sunne, to gouerne the light in the day time, &amp; the starres to lighten the darkenes of the night. Yet if he doth but speak the word, the Sunne pulleth in his light, and shineth no more then if it were not yet risen: and he closeth vp the starres as it were vnder a signet, that they should giue no light. 8 Now the heauens which he hath made round, and which on euery side, as a large and faire roofe, he hath spred ouer our heads, doe shevv forth, together vvith this his vnsearchable povver his no lesse vvisdome in the frame and gouernment of such an excellent vvorke. And he it is likevvise, vvho ruleth the vvaues and raging sourges of the sea, as it vvere vvalking in the middle of them. 9 Moreouer the vvhole skie from the North Pole, vvhich lyeth in our sight, to the South Pole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath vs, vvhich is hidden from vs, the skie, I say, decked and beset vvith so many bright and glittering starres, vvhich doe after a sort gouerne the fovvre seasons of the yeare, doeth it not represent, and in a manner set before our eyes, the vvis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, the Creator and gouernour of all thinges. 10 Therefore most true it is, that he is the vvorker and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of so great and so vvonderfull things, that they can not either be sought out, or numbred. 11. Whom also, when he is neere me and when he offereth himselfe vnto me, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can beholde with mine eies, nor comprehend in my minde and vnderstanding.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Behold, be it he hath taken avvaie, vvho shall make him to restore</hi> (it?) <hi>Who shall say vnto him, vvhat doest thou?</hi>

For his will is the true and onely
<pb facs="tcp:1955:98"/> rule of iustice it selfe. 13. But if any man trusting to his owne power, (such as are sometimes found, loftie &amp; high minded men;) shall either atttempt any thing himselfe against God, or take part with them, with whome God is displeased, so much the more will his anger be kindled against them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will he leaue till he haue vtterly rased them out.</p>

Verely my minde would neuer giue me thus to doe, albeit I were free from the least blemish of sinne, but I would rather craue mercie at his handes, beeing my iudge. 16. But bee it, that I durst challenge this of him, and hee should giue me leaue to speake for my selfe, and debate the matter with him, yet is it not likely that hee would iudge on my side, namely, that himselfe hath done me any wrong. 17. &amp; 18. For he is not changeable. And behold he hath not onely afflicted me, but euen beaten me as it were to powder, not as beeing a little displeased, but shooting thunderbolts from heauen: neither hath he wounded me in one or two places, but he hath heaped blowes vpon blowes and that in
<pb facs="tcp:1955:98"/> such sort, as if he would wreake his whole anger vpon me; in so much that he hath not giuen me any time to breath, but hath whollie filled me with bitternes and affliction, so that I must needes dispaire of euer recouering those things, which you willed me to hope for.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. What? shall I oppose force against force, seeing he alone is moste mightie? but if I shall goe about to sue him at law, who shal make him appeare or bring him to his answer?</p>

I say againe, if I shall dreame, that I am perfit, I shall not knowe my self, and when he shall examine my life according to the perfit rule of righteousnes, I shall bee compelled to abhorre and detest my selfe, and mine owne filthines in his sight.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>This is one pointe: therefore I saide, he destroieth both the righteous and the wicked.</hi>

                  <p n="22">22 All which things tend, to this end which I will not hide from you, namely that God doth alwaies vse his power iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet farre otherwise then yee imagine. For you say, that it standeth with Gods iustice, either alwaies to blesse the godlie in this life, or else when they goe astray and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repent, to chastice and correct them for a time, so that he neuer suffer them to continue to the end of their life, in that miserie and affliction, which hee hath laid vpon them: and contrariwise either forthwith to roote out the wicked, as whome he hateth and abhorreth, or else the more patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he suffereth them for a time, the more grieuouslie and fearfullie to punish and take vengeance of them in this life. But I tell you that herein you are deceiued. For if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the course of this life, doubtlesse we can not determine either of Gods iustice or of mens merits, by the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or discommodities thereof. For miseries and afflictions
<pb facs="tcp:1955:99"/> of all sorts, are common both to good and bad, with which one and the same God will in this life bring to confusion both the one and the other. 23. Neither need we go farre to prooue this. For if it were as you say, God as soone as hee taketh his scourge in his hand, would forthwith destroy the wicked, so that not one of them should be left: and againe it should suffice him, gently to chastice the godlie, and then by and by to withdraw his hand from afflicting them. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise we se verie manie vpright and virtuous men in such sort afflicted, that, if you looke onely vnto the vse of this life, hee may seeme to take delight &amp; pleasure in their miseries: namely, if any may giue credit to your assertion. 24. And on the other side, the godlie being thus afflicted, doe we not see and behold, howe the wicked doe not onely liue, but inioy prosperitie, they sit in the throne of maiestie and rule ouer kingdomes and nations, and without any controlement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all equitie and iustice? Which things, if we say they are done beside the vvill and foreknowledge of God, vve shall thrust God out of the vvorld? and vvhome then shall vvee make the creatour and gouernour of the vvorld?</p>

                  <p>And contrariwise how flitting &amp; vnconstant the prosperity is of such as followe virtue, and endeauour to liue honestlie and vprightlie in the feare of God, let my example witnes. For my former life replenished with so manie blessings, is so suddenly passed away, that no poste may in swiftnes be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to it; and all those things were taken from me, almost before I had any feeling of them: finallie no ship flieth more swiftlie vnder saile, no eagle is caried more swiftly to ceaze vpon her pray.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1955:99"/> vanished, so contrariwise the afflictions, wherewith I am pearsed, sticke fast by me, and I can not any way be rid from them.

                  <p>IOB hauing as it weare cited his freinds before Gods iudgement feate, first he protesteth, that he is driuen to doe this which hee doth against his will, as being constrained by their false accusation to take this course, vers. <hi>1.</hi> and thence forward he beginneth to plead his owne cause. And this one thing is in all these complaints to bee obserued, that Iobs purpose is not to present himselfe before Gods iudgement seate, as if he were voide of all sinne (for he doth both in verie manie places going before, and in the whole former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and also in the Chapter, following acknowledge the contrarie) but onely to free himselfe from the wrongfull and slaunderous accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his aduersaries, who charged him with a dissembled holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and feare of God, and with much wicked and vniust dealing towards men: by which he had drawne vpon himselfe this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie iudgement of God. Therefore he standeth in the defence of a good cause, and mainteineth a iust quarrell, howsoeuer partly the bitternes of his griefe, and partlie the indignitie of this shamelesse slaunder, wrung from him some speeches which might bewray mans infirmitie, which neuerthelesse he doth euer now and then mitigate. This therefore being set downe, which hee testifieth in the last verse of the former Chapter, and in the <hi>7.</hi> verse of this chapter, namely,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:100"/> that he reuerenced and feared God from his verie heart according to his power, as afterward in the <hi>29.</hi> Chapter he is compelled more plainely to lay open, and that hee was farre from doing or hauing done anie man iniurie: hereupon he reasoneth with himselfe, verse <hi>2.3.4.5.6.</hi> how it should come to passe that God should deale more hardly and more vnmercifully with him, then with other most vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vngodlie persons▪ and finding no meanes to resolue this doubt (vvhich thing happened also to the Prophets, as Psal. <hi>73.</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. Abac. <hi>2.</hi>) he laboureth to mooue God vnto compassion by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie arguments, dispairing vvholly of this life, &amp; sometimes excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding measure, but so, that he alvvaies confesseth himselfe to depend vpon Gods vvill and heauenlie prouidence.</p>

                  <p>MY soule is wearie of this so miserable life: I will suffer my complaintes to haue their full swinge, as touching these afflictions which are laid vpon me. I will vtter whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the bitternes of my torments shall put in my minde.</p>

                  <p>I wil speake vnto God in this maner. Now, I beseech thee, let me not bee pronounced guiltie, neither giue sentence of condemnation against me, till such time, as I may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand why, and for what cause I am called vnto iudgement.</p>

For farre bee it from me, once to thinke, that thou art delighted with violent and wrongfull oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any man, or takest pleasure in the destruction of thine owne worke. For wicked iudges are accustomed to take this
<pb facs="tcp:1955:101"/> counsell and to follow this course, whom thou being a moste iust and righteous iudge canst not confirme or incourage by thine own example, as it were by a light shining from aboue.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Thou knovvest that I am guiltlesse of those crimes, and</hi> (yet) <hi>who may deliuer me out of thine hande?</hi>

                  <p>What then may I doe or whether may I turne my selfe, wretch that I am? For truly those things are not incident to thy nature.

                  <p>TSOPHAR the third of Iobs friends, as he spake last, so is he herein more to be blamed then his fellowes, that whereas he ought to haue vnderstood by Iobs answers, that he was wrongfullie accused, he contrariwise beginning with a most bitter invective, ver. <hi>2. &amp; 3.</hi> openly playeth the Sophister, so interpreting those thinges, which Iob had said both before in the <hi>6</hi> Chap. ver. <hi>10.</hi> &amp; in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, verse <hi>7.</hi> in defence of his innocencie, as if Job had maintained that he was free from all sinne, whereas notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding he had not once or twise, but very often witnessed &amp; confessed him selfe to be a sinner: in so much that albeit he were without sinne, yet he could not be accounted cleare and pure in the sight of God. But you will say: whereof then did Job complaine? Surely for that coniecturing by the greatnesse of his miseries, they charged him most falsely to be an vngodly hypocrite, and a very wicked man. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer therefore Tsophar speaketh from the <hi>4.</hi> verse to the <hi>13.</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the infinite and vnsearchable wisedome of God, is indeed very truely and grauely discoursed, but yet nothing fitly to convince Iob: albeit Iob herein had not kept within compasse, and therefore had deserued blame: because he had more boldly then became him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with God, desiring that the cause of this his so extraordinarie visitation, might be disclosed and made knowen vnto him. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, that discouereth Tsophar his vndiscrete rashnes, that he durst so presumptuously iudge, that God if he should come and speake face to face with Iob, would vtterly condemne him and pronounce him worthie of double punishment. For contrariwise God him selfe appearing to Iob, acquitteth him, and spareth those his friends at Iobs earnest intreatie for them. Seeing then that out of all these allegations from the <hi>13.</hi> vers. to the ende of the Chapter, which nothing at all concerne Job, Tsophar concludeth nothing but that which Eliphaz &amp; Bildad had said before him, namely, that this was the only remedie left for Job, if he acknowledging him selfe for such a one as they accused him to be, and so earnestly detesting him selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:103"/> would craue pardon at Gods hands: it followeth that Iob could not follow this their counsell, vnlesse he would lie against his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

                  <p>THis is the second encounter of Iobs friends, wherein they doe not offend as before through ignorance, but euen of plaine wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and obstinacie. And Elephaz still marcheth first and giueth
<pb facs="tcp:1955:112"/> the onset, albeit he was the most graue and auncient of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. So hard a thing is it especiallie in disputing and reasoning to avoid selfelove, as euen in these times experience daily teacheth vs. For it is God alone who can put into mens mindes, a true earnest desire of seeking the trueth, he onely is able to perswade them that it is the best and most glorious kinde of victorie to giue place to the truth. Eliphaz therefore beginning with a taunting and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe in the <hi>2.</hi> and <hi>3.</hi> verses, in the verie necke thereof wresteth in no reason, but a meere cauill, as though, whereas Iob had saide that the extreme miseries of this life, are common to the godlie and the wicked, it should thereupon necessarilie follow that the seruice &amp; worship of God is vnprofitable, &amp; that it is altogether in vain to poure out our prayers vnto him: or else, whereas Iob through the bitternesse of his griefe, and vnreasonablenesse of his aduersaries, was somewhat caryed beyond the boundes of that reuerence, which is due vnto God, and reasoneth the matter somewhat hotly with God, that therefore he bewrayed his manifest contempt of his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, no otherwise then the most rascall and shamelesse sort of men vse to doe. But that Iob thought nothing lesse then this wherewith Eliphaz chargeth him, I haue shewed before. Nowe Eliphaz. the more he goeth forward, the farther is he caryed from the question which is in hand. And first of all in the verses <hi>7.8.9.10.</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth at Iob, is if he did fondly take to him selfe the name of a wise man, making no account at all of his friends. Afterward he subtillie or at the least vnconsiderately vnderstandeth all that which Job had spoken in his owne defence, as if he cleared him selfe from all sinne, before the tribunall seate of God: whereas notwithstanding Iob in expresse wordes had witnessed that no man is cleare in Gods sight, and also asked pardon for his sinnes. Neither did he avouch his owne innocencie in any other sort, then to signifie that his friendes did him great iniurie, iudging of his former life by his present calamitie. In the <hi>17. verse</hi> againe he vseth a short, but yet a loftie preface: and thence forwarde he verie liuelie setteth foorth the most iust and seuere iudgements of God against those who worke wickednesse, not obscurely applying and wresting them against Iob, from which notwithstanding he (as God him selfe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth witnesse of him) was of all other men most free.</p>

                  <p>IT is manifest both by the speaking of Eliphaz about the end of this conference (whereof afterward wee shall heare) and by verie manie places of this disputation, together with diuers probable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that these speeches were not priuately vttered, but in the presence and hearing of manie. Hence it is that Bildad now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth as it were to speake vnto the auditorie, though by and by hee turneth is talke to Iob. Neither yet is it vnlikely, that among others he includeth also his companions. It greeued him to se this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiō to last thus long &amp; with arguing to &amp; fro, stil to be continued, especially about a matter, as he thought and iudged, more cleere then that it needed anie great debating or long disputation. For as onely vnskilfull and ignorant men are accustomed thus to doe (of whome the Comicall Poet sayth trulie, that nothing in the world is more vnreasonable then an ignorant person, who thinketh nothing well
<pb facs="tcp:1955:118"/> done, but that which he doeth him selfe) but also and euen more es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallie they, who by ouermuch confidence in them selues, abusing the knowledge and wisedom which God hath giuen them, account it a great iniurie, if any dissent from them in opinion and iudgement. And such a one Bildad here sheweth him selfe to be, vttering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against poore Job, but most bitter invectives, and repeating those things which his companions had before spoken concerning Gods iust iudgements against the wicked: which surely are verie true and excellent speeches, but yet most falsely and wrongfullie wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted against Iob.</p>

Neuertheles he rightly denieth, that he is therefore to be accompted in the number of lewd and wicked persons, or that he had deserved to be dealt withall in so taunting and reprochfull manner: nay rather that his case was
<pb facs="tcp:1955:120"/> so much the more to be pitied, by how much the greater his affliction was. And surely in this last answere, Iobs faith and constancie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth marveilously: for he witnesseth most plainely, that neither the vnluckie threatnings of his adversaries, nor the bitternesse of his so many and so great afflictions can so farre discourage him, but that, albeit he despaire of this life, neuerthelesse, relying him selfe vpon the power and goodnesse of God, how hardly soeuer now he dealeth with him, he retaineth a most sure and stedfast hope of his resurrection, &amp; of taking againe the verie same flesh &amp; body, therin to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of eternall life, to enioy the sight and presence of God his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.

And what shall I saie to bee the cause, why they are suffered to liue, why to lenghthen out their daies to the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:126"/> verie vttermost course of nature, why to abound in all wealth and riches? 8 Moreouer, their children, howsoeuer thou doest affirme the contrary, remaine in safetie in the presence of their fathers, who behold them with their eyes, howe they growe vp in strength and lustinesse. 9 Their families are peaceable, and without all feare, neither doeth God chastise them with his scourges. 10 By reason their bullockes happily ingender, and their cowes neuer cast their calues, their cattell is wonderfully &amp; mightily increased. 11 Their little ones being brought vp at home by flockes, doe cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and merily skippe vp &amp; downe. 12 And partly they sing and tune their voyces like the timbrels &amp; the harpe, and partly they delight them selues with diuers instruments of musicke. 13 Finally, this life being thus passed ouer in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, in delights, in mirth &amp; pastime, neuer being tormented with any long diseases, as it were in a moment they go downe vnto the graue. 14 And yet notwithstanding they brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king foorth into open contempt of Gods maiestie, haue bid him to depart from them, to get him hence, and to bee pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as if they had nothing to doe with him: neither would they at any time suffer them selues to be taught and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by him. 15 And which is yet more outragious, they haue not doubted to vtter these blasphemous and fearefull speeches, Who is the Almightie, that we should yeelde and submit our selues vnto him? and what good or profite shall wee reape, by povvring out our prayers before him?</p>

                     <hi>THE THIRD EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of Jobs friends.</hi> THE SVMME AND ORDER of the xxii. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>IOB hauing bene by his friendes very grieuously and vnadvised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accused, as though it must needs follow, because he was so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so suddenly afflicted, that God therefore was highly displeased with him, as who is neuer angrie with men, vnlesse their sinnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him thereunto neither being mooued, doth any otherwise punish them, then according to the qualitie of their offences: Iobs friends, J say, after they had very fondly accused him, they brought the whole controuersie to this point; That we are to iudge &amp; esteeme of Gods loue or hatred toward any man, and consequently either of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or wicked life of a man, thereafter as we see his estate in this present life to be flourishing &amp; happie, or miserable &amp; wretched: &amp; that as the punishment of those who lightly offend, is neither grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous nor continuall, but moderate: so they who cōmit heinous sinnes, are not lightly &amp; for a while, but very seuerely &amp; a long time puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; yea and vnlesse they repent, vtterly destroyed. We haue heard therefore, howe Iobs friendes affirmed and held these things against him, &amp; how he denyed &amp; disprooved the same, sometime standing vpon the innocencie of his former life, and appealing vnto the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seat of God him selfe against his accusers: sometime also shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in generall by examples alleaged, how that those two grounds of their accusation were very foolish &amp; to no purpose: namely, that all calamities of this life proceed from Gods anger, as also that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are alwaies punished in this life for their transgressions. It was therefore great reason, that these Iobs friendes should either take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this his exception (which they possibly coulde not doe) or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that their generall treatise, should betake themselues to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and prooue by manifest and certen testimonies those thinges whereof they had accused Iob, or at the least change their mindes &amp; leaue off to accuse him any longer. But Eliphaz, we see, encoūtring nowe the <hi>3.</hi> time with Iob, doeth quite contrarie, who hauing either
<pb facs="tcp:1955:129"/> through forgetfulnesse, or stubburnely passed ouer the question it selfe, and taking an occasion of that, that Iob neither in defending his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, when he was by their sharpe invectiues prouoked thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: neither in bewailing his miserie, when he was almost ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the greatnesse of anguish both of body and minde, had alwayes kept a iust measure, doeth first of all in the foure former ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses very bitterly, falsely, and without cause gather, that certaine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities as it were necessarily followad vpon his speeches. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, he doeth not nowe in the verses <hi>5.6.7.8.9.10.11.</hi> couertly, as he had done before, but openly accuse Job, as if he had bene one, who had vncivillie, covetously, and cruellie abused both his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and wealth: yea, and euen to the <hi>20.</hi> verse he so chargeth him with impietie, and doeth in such bitter and taunting manner wrest and turne vpon Job him selfe all those thinges which he had in the <hi>14.15.16.</hi> verses of the Chapter going before, very truely and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously spoken against prophane men, that nowe he seemeth (forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he neither by reasons nor testimonies doeth avouch these his so bitter accusations) most manifestly to play the part of a spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and reprochfull speaker, rather then of an accuser. Last of all, he beginneth, as if he had brought his matters to an excellent passe, to exhort Iob that he would acknowledge these things, and craue at Gods handes mercie for his heinous sinnes, putting him in hope that he should surely be restored vnto his former estate: affirming more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that following this his counsell, he should not onely be received againe into Gods favour, but God should also heare him, if he made intercession for other men. And truely it is a wonderfull thing that Eliphaz did foretell what should afterward fall out: albeit he did it ignorantly and not thinking any thing at all of that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For both Iob him selfe against all exspectation in this life, had an excellent ende of all these calamities: and Eliphaz also with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes were by Jobs intercession restored into Gods fauour.</p>

But on the contrarie side, the same is with the false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of slaunderous and detracting tongues sharpened, as it were, with a whetstone, hereby gathering strength and courage, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its power and efficacie to shine more and more, as appeareth by these last answers of Job: which doubtlesse, in such extreme miserie is a thing most rare, and admirable. In this Chapter therefore Iob taking in hand to refute those things, which Eliphaz had vttered far wide from the true meaning of that question, which was then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie; in the second verse hauing shortlie, and in a word expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the greatnes of his miserie, in the tenne next verses following, he
<pb facs="tcp:1955:132"/> doth againe appeale vnto the tribunall seat of God himselfe, against those false and vniust accusations of his friends: trusting both in Gods iustice and in the vndoubted testimonie of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For as touching God, whose decrees and counsels alwaies stand and agree with his eternall truth and iustice, howsoeuer man is not able to comprehend the reason and equitie thereof, he witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of him selfe, that he taketh in good part whatsoeuer it pleaseth God to laie vpon him, and that he will rest and staie him selfe in his heauenly will and pleasure, yea, though he proceed to deale with him as he had begun. And yet that he can not otherwise choose, but be verie much troubled and disquieted in minde, by reason of this his vnhappie estate; yea and that he doth especiallie marvell, how it commeth to passe, that amidst so extreame and intollerable miseries, he is able to continue and protract his life. And here againe this is greatlie to bee marueiled at, that that thing was extraordinarilie graunted vnto Job, which, howsoeuer he did greatlie affect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, yet durst neyther hope nor aske for: namely, that he at the length should behold the Lorde, and that his accusers should be cast, and iudgement passe against their cause, before the tribunall seate of God, the creatour of heauen and earth.</p>

For I would not stick to approche to his iudgment seat, there to plead my cause not against him (as being the supreame iudge and not either plaintiue or defendant) but against your false and wrongful accusations, which vndoubtedly I would disproue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute by many forcible and strong arguments. 5 I vvould glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare what aunswere he would returne me being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant vpon him against you, yea I would vnderstand, what verdit he would giue concerning my right and cause 6. For doubtles he would not vse that his mightie and inuincible force and power, wherein he excelleth al other, to oppresse me, but rather to strengthen and vphold me. 7. And there at the lēgth I should haue free libertie to maintain my right, beeing altogether guiltles and innocent before the moste righteous iudge, and these your peremptorie iudgements, which at your pleasure you giue forth against me, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled and made void, I should at the length be freed from these your iniurious and spiteful accusations.</p>

                  <p n="8">8 But I confesse indeed, that there is an infinite difference between this iudgement seate, which I so greatlie desire, and the courts of worldlie and earthly iudges. For whether I go directlie forwarde, or turne my footesteppes backward, all commeth to one end: I can not find him, he appeareth not, no where can I behold him. 9 Suppose that he is present at the left hand, yet is he not to be seene of me: be it, that he standeth at the right hand, yet can I not fasten mine eies vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; and it is all one to me, as if he should hide himselfe in some secret place. 10 But what then? shal I therefore let fall my sute, and leaue off this mine appellation; In no wise will I so doe. For there is no such necessitie, that hee should exhibit himselfe in any personall and visible presence, or that I should declare or laie open my case before him, to the end hee may the better vnderstand the rightnes of my cause: but he knoweth best how I haue walked; hee is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie acquainted with the whole course of my life, and I am fully assured, that hee will not rashlie and vnaduisedlie condemne me, as ye doe, but after due examination and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all made, both of me and of my cause, my sentence defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue shall bee pronounced, in so much, that I shall departe from the barre, where he is supervisor and iudge, more pure then the golde which hath bin tried in the fire. 11. For I haue foote by foot trode in his steppes. and that so carefully, that I haue not once turned out of the way, which hee hath commaunded. 12 To conclude, I haue taken so great delight in those ordinances, which our forefathers receiuing from his mouth, haue deliuered vnto vs, that laying them vp in the treasure house of mine heart, I haue preferred them before whatsoeuer was requisite and necessary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and preseruation of this present life.</p>

                  <p n="14">14 <hi>Doubtlesse he will performe my decree</hi> (that is, that which he hath decreed of me) <hi>and manie such things are with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13 And if so be that by his eternall and immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, he meane still to proceed thus against me, who is hee that can change his minde, and withdrawe him from this his

For that which he is once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to doe, that which he hath ordained and decreed, the same he doeth without contradiction, and nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from bringing it to passe. 14 Nowe surelie let him accomplish whatsoeuer he hath decreed of mee, I shall not be against it. For hee is accustomed to doe manie such things, the certen reason whereof is onely knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and altogether hidden from vs.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 <hi>Therefore at the sight of him J stand amased, and when J consider this, I am afraid of him.</hi>

                  <p>IOB in the former CHAPTER hauing refuted those thinges, which Eliphaz had spoken partlie beside the purpose, and partlie particularlie against him, now commeth directlie to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, in the first verse auouching that to be true, which he had vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered before in the 21. Chapter: namely, that God, as well in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb facs="tcp:1955:134"/> the righteous from the iniuries of the wicked, as also in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the sinnes of lewde and vngodlie persons, dealeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies openlie, but somtimes vseth a secret and altogether vnsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner of proceeding, not giuing any man to know either the time when, or the reason why he doth this or that thing. For those who feare and serue the Lorde in trueth and sinceritie of heart, are not yet so much priuie vnto the Lordes counsells, as that they doe know the daie and time, which he hath set and appointed for their deliuerance out of the tirannie and oppression of the wicked, in so much that if the opinion of Iobs friendes should take place, God might seeme either not to see, or seeing, not to regard this great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order &amp; confusiō, if we barely look into the present state &amp; conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this life. In this Chapter therefore especially are handled these two pointes: the first concerning Gods not redeeming the righteous out of their troubles, is most excellentlie discoursed in the thirteene former verses. The other point touching Gods forbearing of the wicked, is no lesse grauely and effectuallie set forth in the twelue verses next and immediatlie following: and at length in the last verse he shutteth vp the whole disputation. Now that is most true, which Iob doth maintaine against his aduersaries, to wit, that wee ought not to iudge either of Gods good will and fauour towardes anie man, by his prosperitie, nor of Gods hatred and displeasure towards him, by his aduersitie, partlie God himselfe doth afterward declare, and partlie the histories of all nations, and especiallie of the Church, doth sufficientlie testifie. And concerning this matter, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scripture doth almost euerie where determine, but in the Psalme <hi>73.</hi> and <hi>29.</hi> Ierem. <hi>15.</hi> Habac. <hi>1.</hi> this argument is principally and purposelie handled. Neither surely can it anie way more certenlie and manifestlie be collected and gathered, that there remaineth an other iudgement after this life, for which God hath set and prefixed a time, though the same bee hidden from vs, it can not, I say, more manifestlie be collected, then by this, that we see none so flourish &amp; prosper in this life, as the wicked and vngodlie, none to be all their life time so contemptible and miserable, as the best and the most vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, so farre as concerneth the outward blessings and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this life.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>HOwe should not the times be hidden which the Almightie hath appointed? seeing they that knowe him see not his dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to let al these things passe, which do peculiarly touch my selfe, I will come to the matter which is in hand: where first I would gladly demaunde this one question of you, by what reason it can be denied, that the times &amp; seasons, which the Almightie, whose wisedome &amp; power is infinite, &amp; not to be resisted, hath appointed for al things, are by the wil of god hidden frō men: seeing euē they who acknowledge &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worship the true God, can not behold the day of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the tiranny and oppression of the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>They will passe ouer the land markes: they take flockes away by violence, and feede them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>They make the poore to turne out of the way: the poore of the land hide them selues together.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Loe, they are wilde asses in the wildernesse: they goe foorth as it were to their businesse: earely in the morning they seeke their pray, the wildernesse</hi> (is) <hi>bread to them.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12 <hi>The men of the citie doe grone, &amp; the soules of the slaine cry out, &amp; God doth not set down</hi> (that is, doth not obserue or mark)

                     <hi>their grosse dealing,</hi> (that is, this which they doe against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and equitie.)</p>
                  <p n="13">13 (Yet) <hi>these oppose them selues against the light, they know not the wayes thereof, neither continue they in the pathes thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 For what is it that these men dare not doe? For not regarding the land markes, which are set for the deuiding of one mans ground from another, and in keeping whereof, no small part of the publicke peace and tranquillitie consisteth, they incroche vpon other mens groundes, and there feede heardes of cattell and flockes of sheepe, which they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so violently and wrongfully taken from others. 3 Yea, they are so much delighted with tyrannie and oppression, that they spare not the heardes of the fatherlesse, but robbe and spoyle what it pleaseth them: by force they seaze vpon the goods of the widowe, as if by good right and title they tooke them for pledge of such debtes as are due to them. 4 When these spoylers are abroade, they beset the wayes, and no traveller, be he neuer so poore and needie, can passe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them; in so much that they are constrained to leaue the broad beaten way, &amp; euery where to seeke out bye wayes and vnknowen passages to escape their handes. 5 For these are rather to be accompted wilde and savadge beasts, then men: not vnlike to the wilde asses, which keepe in the wildernesse, early in the morning they prepare and harnesse them selues and goe foorth vnto the spoile, as if this were their trade and occupation, whereby they must needes get their living. Fieldes and tillage they haue none, but the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse and desert places, in which they practise this their pillage, are to them in steade of great lands and possessions: out of which they gather no small revenues, &amp; furnish them selues with all necessarie provision for this life. 6 In the time of haruest they reape downe other mens corne, and by force carie it away: and not being herewith contented, they robbe other mens orchardes and vineyardes, beguiling the poore of the latter vintage. 7. &amp; 8 Those that come in their handes, they despoile of their garments, and leaue them naked in the open aire without shelter, making them to lye all night in the colde without taking any sleepe, and being washed with the moisture, that in the night season falleth
<pb facs="tcp:1955:135"/> from the mountaines, and being weake and feeble, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the rockes, and die miserable. 9 Loe, these are the outrages, which they commit abroade: nowe at home they shewe them selues no lesse savadge and cruell. For if so be that they are to deale with poore men, they wil not sticke to take the young infant from the mothers dugge, for a pledge of some smal debt which is owing them. 10. and 11 And as for the hirelings, whome they haue set about their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie businesse, to carrie burdens, to make oyle, to treade downe the winepresse, they are so farre from paying them their wages, which is due to them for their labour, that they dismisse and send them away both hungrie and thirstie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one morsell of bread or a cuppe of drinke. 12 The miserable and languishing inhabitants within the citie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and grone vnder the burden of these injuries, and the blood of them that are slaine, cryeth to God for vengeance. Nowe then, what are we to thinke of God, if we shall esteeme of his iudgemēts as ye would haue vs, by that present estate, in which we see euery man to be in this life: this I am sure of, that if any will entertaine your opinion, he must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie confesse, that God either seeth not, or seeing, regardeth not this disorder and confusion, and this contempt of lawes both humane and divine. 13 Neuerthelesse, these ought to haue bene defended from their tyrannie, who not onely breake the lawes of nature, and extinguish the light of their owne conscience, which reprooveth these their doings, but also cast behinde their backes those sacred rules and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which our auncetours receiving from God, haue left vnto vs, for the framing of our liues to an honest and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conuersation.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 <hi>The murtherers rise earely, they slay the poore and needie: and in the night they</hi> (are) <hi>as theeves.</hi>

                  <p n="14">14 And this truely is the lot and portion of them, who in this life are thus oppressed. Nowe let vs come to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressours them selues. Beholde, some of them liuing by the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:136"/> spoyle and slaughter of other men, rise out of their beds at the day breake, and goe foorth, slaying those whome they meete withall, and such as are not able to make resistance: others there are, who make choise of the night for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and robberies. 15 In the number of these, are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, who going about to defile the marriage bed, looke for the twilight, and that they may not be descryed, they goe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised and couered. 16 Others also in the night digge through houses, which they haue marked out for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and surveyed in the day time. And all these flee the light, and are delighted with darkenesse.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 <hi>Therefore so soone as</hi> (it is) <hi>morning,</hi> (it is) <hi>to them the shadowe of death: therefore</hi> (I say, so soone as) <hi>knowledge may be had</hi> (that is, men can knowe) <hi>and discerne one another,</hi> (they are) <hi>in the terrours of the shadowe of death.</hi>

                  <p n="17">17 And this truely is their order and manner of liuing. But here I haue heard some of you obiecting against me, that howsoeuer these men doe liue, as they list, without lawe or reason, yet neuerthelesse they escape not scotfree and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnpunished. For the day light is a death to them: yea, so soone as by the benefit of the light, one man may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne another, they are no lesse afraid and amased, then if they were alreadie at deathes doore. 18 And albeit they prosper &amp; continue for a time, yet their estate is very tickle, and they are caryed this way and that way with euery small blast of winde, they wauer and flote vp and downe, as if they were swimming vpon the waters: and besides, a curse lyeth both vpon them selues, and vpon all whatsoeuer they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse,
<pb facs="tcp:1955:136"/> till they depart this life, being altogether vnlike to the vine, which by cutting and pruining sprowteth out, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth more profitable. 19 But it falleth out with them quite contrarie: For as through drouth and heat the snowe is straightway melted, and appeareth not any where: so these, that giue them selues to worke wickednesse, the graue suddenly swalloweth them vp, and taketh them from among the companie of men. 20 And being once dead, neither their mothers, nor their wiues doe bewayle and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their deathes, but they become daintie and pleasaunt foode for the wormes: their name is blotted out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of men, being like a tree which is cut from the stocke, and will neuer budde nor bring foorth fruite. 21 And this truely is Gods iust iudgement against them, who rewardeth them according to their desertes, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them the like favour, as they shewed to others: as who haue hardly and cruellie vsed their barren wiues, vpon purpose to keepe them from bearing children: and haue not had any care to releeve their mothers being poore and desolate widowes: no marvaile then, if the wife coulde not bewayle so vnkinde an husbande, nor the mother so vnnaturall a sonne. 22 Moreouer, these haue by force brought mightie men vnder their girdle, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to doe them homage and seruice: in so much, that if they were displeased, no man coulde assure him selfe of his life.</p>
                  <p n="23">23 (God) <hi>giueth them for their assurance, and</hi> (whereunto) <hi>they may leane: and his eyes</hi> (are) <hi>vpon his wayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24 <hi>They are exalted for a little, and they are not: but they are brought downe euen as others: they are stopped, but they are cut off as the toppe of an eare of corne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23 But to this obiection of yours, I oppose that answer, which I haue vsed before, and which as yet ye haue not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved, neither indeede can you: namely, that God neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles bestoweth plentifully vpon these lewde &amp; wicked mē, whatsoeuer belongeth to the maintenance &amp; preseruation of this life, so that they feare no dāger, but liue euē as thēselues list: as if Gods eyes were continually fixed vpon them, to see that they should wāt nothing, but that all things shold fal out
<pb facs="tcp:1955:137"/> with them according to their heartes desire. 24 For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, as the life of man is indeede very short, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted only for a time, and are by and by gone, yet death doth no otherwise ouertake them and bring them downe, then it doeth any other: and howbeit that when they dye, their mouthes are also stopped, yet are they not cut downe by any violent and vntimely death, but in their olde age, when as they are farre stricken in yeeres, euen as the wheate, when the corne field is white to the haruest.</p>
                  <p n="25">25 <hi>But if not nowe</hi> (that is, goe to) <hi>who will prooue me a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar? and bring my wordes to nothing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe if there be any man of a contrarie opinion in this point, goe to, let him come foorth and reprooue me of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, let him disprooue this mine answer, and shewe that it is vaine and to no purpose.</p>

                  <head>THE SVMME AND ORDER of the XXV. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>IN this Chapter is set downe the thirde encounter of Bildad, in which he quite digresseth from the question that is in hande, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the prosperous and happie estate of the wicked, together with the wofull and miserable condition of the righteous, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into the description of the power and maiestie of God, as if Iob, maintaining his innocencie against the reprochefull slaunders of his accusers, had taken vpon him to charge God with iniustice, for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thus hardly with him: which thing was very false, for so much as Job doeth euery where acknowledge him selfe a sinner, and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth most reverently of that incomprehensible maiestie of God. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse it can not be denyed (which I haue verie often repeated, and for which Iob is reprooued afterward by Elihu, and in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect also he him selfe doeth craue pardon at Gods handes) that Iob being wel nigh overthrowen partly with the odious and despitefull accusations which his friendes layde against him, and partly with the greatnesse and extremitie of his torments, went nowe and then too farre in defending him felfe, and avouching his owne integritie and vprightnesse. But howsoeuer Bildad doeth amisse in wrongfully applying this his speech, yet he thinketh &amp; speaketh very truly, verie
<pb facs="tcp:1955:137"/> grauely, and verie reuerentlie of God: so that it may more trulie be saide of him, then of <hi>Menelaus,</hi> to whome <hi>Homer</hi> giueth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that his sayings they be but short and few, but yet verie graue, pithie, and sweet.</p>

But forasmuch as he held his peace (either for that he esteemed Iob as a desperate person, of whose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment there was no hope at all; or because he was not able to make his parte good with him, in respect of the truth of his cause, &amp; the strength of his arguments) Iob in the five Chapters next &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie following, goeth forward in the apologie or defence of him selfe: and first in this <hi>27.</hi> Chapter, he sheweth, that whatsoeuer he had before spoken and disputed concerning the happie and prosperous estate of the wicked, was not so be taken, as if God did fauour their proceedings, or as if none of them did tast of Gods fearefull and iust iudgements in this life: Which thing was verie farre from his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For on the contrarie side, he doth confesse and acknowledge, that God iustlie punisheth their wickednes by manifold and sundrie plagues euen in this life (according as he thinketh best:) which is a thing so cleare and euident, that no doubt neede be made thereof. Neuerthelesse he flatlie denyeth, that this is alwaies true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might see how they leaned but to a weake ground &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, whereas by this suddeine and miserable fall they concluded against him. For, saith he, there is a certaine hidden and secret wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, wherby he so gouerneth and ruleth all things, that man by no wit or industrie can atteine to the reason thereof: and vvhich ought indeede rather highlie to be reuerenced, then curiouslie to be searched into, as namelie, when he doth most grieuouslie afflict the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:140"/> godlie, of which number he professeth and prooueth himselfe to bee one, and on the other side, in great patience and long suffering for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth the wicked. Jn breefe therefore Iob in these fiue Chapters doth handle these three things,. Jn this <hi>27.</hi> hee doth intreat of the punishments which euen in this life doe ouertake the wicked, how be it this happeneth not to all, nor yet at all times, but so often and to so manie as it pleaseth God. Jn the <hi>28</hi> Chapter hee reasoneth of the secret and hidden wisdome of God: which argument he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleth generally, that it may haue the greater force and efficacie to conuince the gainsayers, Jn the <hi>29.30.31.</hi> Chapters, he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of the integritie of his former life, till such time as this so sudden and almost incredible calamity came vpon him. In which two things for asmuch as euerie where hee kepe not that measure which was meete, therefore he was worthelie reprooued, first by Eliphaz and that not altogether without bitternes, and then by God himselfe, but yet farre more grauely aed with greater moderation; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wee shall heare.</p>

                  <p>IOB in this Chapter is driuen in moste ample sorte to defend and particularlie to approoue his integritie, by making a catalogue, as it were, and bedrole of all his life past, being thereunto enforced, as it should seeme, by those false accusations and crimes, which Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz had (before from the beginning of the <hi>22.</hi> Chap. to the <hi>11.</hi> vers.) in particular manner obiected against him. And first of all, euen to the <hi>35.</hi> verse, he vseth a most substantiall denyall, and that in verie excellent good order, beginning in the foure first verses with whoredome and vncleannesse of the bodie. Next in the <hi>5.</hi> and <hi>6.</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he intreateth of deceits and couin in bargaining: in the <hi>7.</hi> and <hi>8.</hi> verses of Theft: in the <hi>9.10.11.</hi> &amp; <hi>12.</hi> of Adulterie: in the <hi>13, 14.</hi> &amp; <hi>15.</hi> verses, of the abusing of the authoritie of a master: in the <hi>16.</hi> &amp; <hi>17.</hi> and so foorth to the <hi>28.</hi> vers. of the contempt of the poore, and especiallie of widowes and fatherlesse children: in the <hi>29.</hi> &amp; <hi>30.</hi> of desire to reuenge iniuries receiued: in the <hi>32.</hi> of Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalitie: in the <hi>33.</hi> of cloaking and couering iniquitie. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the <hi>39.</hi> verse he appealeth vnto God as witnesse and iudge, and so shutteth vp the whole defence of his innocencie, inserting here and there most fearfull imprecations &amp; cursings vnto him selfe, if he shall be found a lyar. And that Iob was not one that vsed leasings, God him selfe doeth testifie in the beginning of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as also vvee shall heare in the ende hereof. The cheefest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite therefore that wee are to gather out of this place, is not to know that Iob was iniured and wronged; to which euill none are more subiect then those who follow Iobs example: but by this example eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one in particular, and those especiallie, who haue wherewithall they may in great aboundance shew their virtuous dispositions, are taught how to iudge of the duties of a holie and honest conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both at home and abroad. For I may trulie say and affirme this, Christian reader, that there are moe substantiall and certen precepts concerning a godly and most iust life, comprized in this one Chapter, then are in all the bookes of Philosophers or Historiographers else where to be found.</p>

But I, as ere while I protested, will not for al this as yet leaue off to defend mine innocencie. First therefore I protest, I haue so ordered my life, as that I haue as it were, made a bargaine and couenant with mine eies, that neither they shall entice mee to any filthinesse, neither that I shall abuse them in beholding anie such thing. Farre bee it therefore from mee, that I should in anie impure manner cast mine eies vpon any maiden. For howe should I dare doe this thing, seeing I am not ignorant, howsoeuer I may easilie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the hand of man, what reward such sinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is woont to haue of God, who dwelleth in the heauens: and what vengeance the almightie, beholding and iudging all things from on hie, doeth repay into their bosomes, who are guiltie of this heynous offence? 3 For it is certen that he hath prepared a scourge and moste horrible and grieuous punishments, which cannot possiblie be auoided, for those who nourish and cherish their abhominable iniquitie? 4. And doth not he, I pray you, throughly know me, who, which way soeuer I walke, doth number and tell euen euerie one of my steppes almost, which I doe make.</p>

                  <p>WE haue heard in the beginning of this storie, first, with what exceeding great constancie, and invincible courage of mind, Iob did beare out, and withstand the temptations and forcible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults of Satan, from the <hi>13.</hi> vers. of the <hi>1.</hi> Chap. to the <hi>11.</hi> vers. of the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:153"/> second Chapter. But from that place euen to this <hi>32.</hi> Chapter, hauing beene wonderfullie vexed by the most inconsiderate, bitter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull taunts of them, who came to comfort him, as also by the raging paines in his whol bodie, encreasing vpon him dailie more &amp; more, in most pitiful &amp; grieuous manner; he was driuen to do that, which they are wont to doe, who in a doubtfull daunger turning them selues onelie to the left side, doe leaue their other side naked and open to the enemie. For beeing whollie bent to defend him selfe against those slaunders of his aduersaries, neither marking what Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan chieflie went about, to wit, that at the length he should rise vp against God him selfe, he verie inconsiderately, as it were, before the tribunall seat of GOD, did through many vvordes blemish that constancie of his, yea, and he had almost by breaking foorth into accusations against GOD him selfe, yeelded vp the victorie vnto Satan. But God beeing mooued with compassion towardes this his seruant, (who although he suffer his children sometimes to be pressed out of measure, as the Apostle speaketh of him selfe: yet he neuer so casteth them downe, but that in good time againe he raiseth them vp) first stirred vp Elihu, as well to rebuke the vnwise dealing of Iobs friendes, as also to blame Iob, not in respect of his life past, as they had verie vniustlie done, but by little and little to bring him as one goeing astraie, and who, vnlesse he sought an other refuge then his owne innocencie, and also put on that spirit of meekenes, which willinglie suffereth it selfe to be taught and instructed, was readie forthwith to breake forth into open impietie, by little and little, J saie, to bring him into the way, till such time as God him selfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betweene, should decide and take vp this whole controuersie. And albeit we must needes confesse, that Job gaue no small occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reprehension, but deserued verie greatlie and sharplie to be rebuked, in respect of many things, which were by him very rashlie and vnaduisedlie vttered: yet certen it is, that Elihu doth for the most parte interpret Iobs words farre otherwise, then was Iobs mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and moreouer that euen in finding fault with those thinges, which were iustlie to be founde fault withall, he kept not alwaies that moderation, vvhich vvas meete: vvhich is incident to godlie men, and especiallie such, as are of a more earnest nature and disposition: so hard a thing is it, euen when we doe well, not to offend on the one side or on the other. But if wee consider how
<pb facs="tcp:1955:154"/> farre Iob, beeing thereto driuen through the importunitie of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, and his most intollerable calamitie, did raunge out of the right waie: and how we are all giuen, euen to the vttermost, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and maintaine our credit and estimation, especiallie when we are therin touched by those men, who ought least of all others to haue done the same: we shall confesse, that it was verie requisite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for Iob, rather to be censured in such sharpe manner as hee was, then after any milder sorte: to the end he might the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and humble him selfe before God, as alwaies he had done, till through the slaunderous speeches of his friendes, he was drawne into these altercations. Notwithstanding he was not so farre out of the waie, but that he came into the same againe, as appeareth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie out of the <hi>9.</hi> Chapter, where he acknowledgeth almost in the verie same wordes those things, which both Elihu, as also God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe after Elihu, doe often repeat and beat into his minde. Elihu therefore (a man of an auncient house, whome the learned interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters suppose to haue descended from Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Cap. <hi>22.21.</hi>) hauing heard the former disputations, now when either parties kept silence, beganne to speake, continuing his speech throughout the sixe Chapters immediatelie following, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what blaming Iobs accusers, but more peculiarlie and more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie finding fault with Job him selfe. And first as touching Iob, he setteth downe the ground of his accusation, in the first and second verses of this Chapter, to wit, that he not content to denie himselfe to be such a one, as his three friends falslie charged him to be, to the end they might thereby conclude, that he was thus plagued for his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, not content, I saie, to denie this, went so farre, that he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to saie, that God was not able to finde any cause in him, why to laie vpon him so great affliction: and therefore that GOD could not seeme herein to deale iustlie with him, vnlesse we looke vnto the cause of all causes, which the minde of man is not able to attaine vnto, that is to saie, vnto the will of God, vvhich goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all secondarie causes, as though forsooth, if God would deale ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rigour of his iustice, he should not finde euen in the most holie and righteous men that are, sufficient cause, not onelie in this life, to laie all manner of punishments vpon them, but also to condemne them to vtter destruction.

<pb facs="tcp:1955:154"/> the third verse forward to the ende of the Chapter, for that letting passe that which was in Iob worthie of blame and reprehension, they made no end of charging him with such crimes, whereof they were not able to make any proofe at all.

                  <head>¶ THE SVMME AND ORDER of the 33. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>WEe haue saide that Elihu misconstrued many things, which Iob spake, and that hee did though not vndeseruedly, yet verie bitterlie reprooue the same, which I will make plaine after this sorte. First, to passe ouer his preface contained in the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen verses of this Chapter, wherein no bitternes is wanting, let vs consider of those thinges which are by him reprooued in the ninth verse following, and in the former parte of the tenth verse. For wee shall not finde that Iob anie where spake in such manner. But Elihu doth thus gather because Iob had oftentimes made prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of his own innocencie before the iudgement seat of God, euen in these words: <hi>If I prepare me to iudgement, I shal be iustified:</hi> and againe, <hi>Let me speake, and answere thou me: how many are mine iniquities and sinnes? shew me my rebellion.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>13.</hi> verse <hi>18.22.</hi> and <hi>23.</hi> Which speeches of Iob, doubtlesse, are not so to be taken, as if in the sight and iudgement of God, he estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him selfe to be free from sinne, but wee must remember that they were by him vttered onely in way of answere vnto the false accusations of his friendes, vvho spared not, without all reason to reuile him as a most wicked and vngodlie liuer. For that his meaning was farre from that vvherevvith Elihu chargeth him, it is euident both in other places, and especiallie by the vvordes vvhich hee vseth in the ninth Chapter and in the second verse.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:157"/>
                     <hi>How shall a man iustifie himselfe with God? if he will stand in contention vvith him, hee can not ansvver him one for a thousand.</hi> and in the <hi>14.</hi> Chapter, vers. <hi>4. Who can dravve cleannesse out of vncleannes?</hi> and yet more plainlie in the <hi>9.</hi> Chapter vers. <hi>20.21. If I shall iustifie my selfe, my mouth shall condēne me. Am I perfit? I should not know my soule.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be doubted, but that Elihu doeth misconstrue Iobs wordes, and otherwise take them, then could stand with his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Now as touching the other parte of the tenth verse, together with the eleuenth, true it is that Job, through a certaine immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vehemencie, vseth the verie same wordes in the <hi>13.</hi> Chapter, vers. <hi>14.15.</hi> &amp; <hi>27.</hi> which thing, for asmuch as it proceeded not of pride, and much lesse of anie wicked and rebellious disposition, but of a moste grieuous sense and feeling of intollerable griefe, hee was rather to be comforted and exhorted vnto patience, then thus sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be checked, taunted, and rebuked in his so great extremitie. For it is one thing to exceede measure in so iust a cause of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; an other, presumptuouslie to stand in contention with God, which was alwaies farre from Iobs purpose. Now that which he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the <hi>12.</hi> verse, <hi>God is greater then man:</hi> &amp; in the <hi>13. God speaketh not all his vvordes;</hi> there is no reason at all; why hee shou'd applie it vnto Iob, forasmuch as no man hath reasoned more wisely concerning the vnsearchable wisdome of God in manie of his workes, then Iob hath done almost in euery place of this booke. Now as touching those things which follow to the end of the Chapter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two waies which God vseth to schoole his children, the one more milde, to keep them from falling into sinne, the other more rigorous, when they haue committed wickednes, to bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of their life; although this be true which he speaketh, yet is it nothing to the purpose. For to say the truth, Iob, (howbeit it behooued him to make vse and profit of this his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) was not for either of these causes giuen vp into the hands of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but that in him beeing thus tried, God might triumph ouer his enimie and leaue a most singuler example vnto all posteritie, both of his owne goodnes confirming his children, and also of the patience and constancie of those, vvho trulie and sincerelie worship God. Therefore to conclude, although Elihu did verie well in taking Jobs parte against those his three friendes, as also hee doeth not
<pb facs="tcp:1955:157"/> without good cause, require a greater moderation in Iobs speeches, notwithstanding he left yet vnto Iob manie good and lawfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, which hee peraduenture woulde not long haue concealed, vnlesse God, who doth also him selfe reprooue Job, but yet vvith great equitie and mildnesse, vnlesse God, J say, both in worde and deede, had ended this whole controuersie. But I will afterwarde when better occasion serueth, shewe the reason, both why Iob an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered nothing to this so large and plentifull discourse, which Elihu maketh, and also, why God, sharpely rebuking the other three, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Elihu nothing at all.</p>

                  <head>THE SVMME AND ORDER of the xxxiiii. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>ELihu goeth on still, though not after the same manner that his friendes before had done, yet with more bitternes to accuse Iob to be such a one, as had opposed him selfe against God. And surely we must needes confesse (which thing he him selfe being reprooved by God doeth also acknowledge) that Iob, being by his friends so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriously dealt withall, and so often disquieted, did amidst his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes let slip very many lavish and vnconsiderate speeches, as is to be seene almost throughout the <hi>10.</hi> Chapter: yea, he was so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in disprooving those accusations which his friendes had laide to his charge, that he seemed neither whollie nor patiently to rest on
<pb facs="tcp:1955:160"/> the will and pleasure of God. But it is very manifest and plaine, that it neuer so much as once came into his minde, either to say that him selfe was without sinne, or that God was vniust, as may appeare by verie many places, where he defendeth him selfe. Neuerthelesse Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu in the three first verses vseth a verie graue preface, and very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taking vp a certaine saying of Iobs out of the <hi>12.</hi> Chap. verse <hi>11.</hi> and another in the <hi>4.</hi> verse out of the <hi>9.</hi> Chapter, verse <hi>32.</hi> as it were calleth foorth all those that were present, to giue sentence with him against Iob. Afterward in the <hi>5.6. &amp; 9</hi> vers. he setteth downe the chiefe points of his accusation, intermingling some fewe thinges in the <hi>7. &amp; 8.</hi> vers. to aggravate Iobs foolishnesse. Then in the <hi>10.</hi> verse and so forwarde vnto the <hi>31.</hi> he taketh upon him to confute Iob as touching the same points, still reasoning very wisely of Gods perpetuall and inviolable iustice, albeit this treatise was not greatly necessarie, forasmuch as Iob had neuer denyed or any way impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the iustice of God, but had alwayes spoken thereof reverently, &amp; also had in the <hi>12.</hi> Chap. disputed, concerning the soveraigne and absolute power of God, almost in the very same wordes which Elihu vseth from the <hi>13.</hi> vers. to the <hi>31.</hi> And here againe he perverteth and misconstreth Iobs wordes. For when he avoucheth his owne righteousnesse, his meaning is not to gainsay that which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both in diuers other places, and especially in the <hi>9.</hi> Chapter, verse <hi>20.</hi> spoken in expresse wordes: but he standeth in defence of his innocencie against his adversaries, who neuer ceased to revile him as a most wicked hipocrite. And therefore it behoued him to confute this slaunderous accusation. For God him selfe witnesseth farre otherwise of him, before in the <hi>1.</hi> Chapter, verse <hi>8.</hi> and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>2.</hi> verse <hi>2.</hi> Thus Paul cleereth him selfe vnto the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in his first Epistle, Chapter <hi>4.</hi> verse <hi>4. I knowe nothing,</hi> saith he, <hi>by my selfe,</hi> and he addeth moreouer, <hi>as touching Gods tribunall seate, yet am I not thereby iustified.</hi> Nowe for that saying, <hi>He hath remooued from me my iudgement:</hi> Iob had before in the seven and twentieth Chapter, verse <hi>2.</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the verie same wordes, whereby he meant nothing lesse, then to charge God with vniust dealing. For they haue not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, but rather to the greatnesse of that miserie and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which he then suffered, being so extreme and vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that men looking barely into that state, wherein hee was, must needes thinke that such misfortune coulde not befall any, except he
<pb facs="tcp:1955:161"/> were a most wicked and vngodly person. And that this was Jobs meaning, it may evidently appeare by the whole course of his speech. Neither did Iob adde that clause <hi>(without transgression)</hi> in the <hi>6.</hi> Chap. vers. <hi>14.</hi> which Elihu spitefullie thrusteth in, vers. <hi>6.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie, whereas he findeth fault with Iob in the <hi>9.</hi> vers. as if he had said, that it profiteth a man nothing if he haue walked with God, therein he doeth him great wrong: howbeit the Prophet confesseth that he rashly vttered the like wordes, Psal. <hi>73.13.</hi> For it was verie much different from this, which Iob had most truely spoken, Chap. <hi>9.22.</hi> confuting the slaunderous speeches of his adversaries, to wit, that God destroyeth both the righteous and the wicked, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but that the miseries and afflictions of this life, be they neuer so great, are laide as well vpon the godly as vpon the wicked, and therefore that we ought not to iudge of any mans good or euill disposition, and of his honest or dishonest behaviour by his happie or wretched estate in this life: which to be most true, both this verie example of Job, and also daily experience most plainely prooveth, forasmuch as the estate of the Church in this worlde is such, that it is alwayes subiect to all manner of afflictions. To conclude, Elihu in the <hi>31. and 32.</hi> vers. giueth Iob verie good and wise counsell, as that he would learne to humble him selfe before God, rather then thus to vaunt of his owne righteousnesse, and so presumptuously to debate the matter before Gods tribunall seate. But afterwarde he shutteth vp his speech with no lesse bitternes, then he vsed in the beginning, accusing Iob, as if he went about to commence an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iniurie against God him selfe.</p>

                  <head>¶ THE SVMME AND ORDER of the 35. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>ELihu had before blamed Iob, for that he seemed to complaine of God, as dealing vniustly with him. But now he laieth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to his charge, for vvhich he taketh him vp verie round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the second and third verses: namely, because hee in denying that the vprightnes of his life, had beene anie vvhit more auailea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, then if he had liued vvickedlie: and also going about here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prooue and confirme the same, for that manie beeing wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie oppressed, and flying vnto God for succour, neuerthelesse vvere not heard. Chap. <hi>9,</hi> vers. <hi>22.</hi> and <hi>10.</hi> vers. <hi>15.</hi> and <hi>30.</hi> vers. <hi>20.</hi> in so doing J say, did nothing else but make him selfe as being vvithout all right and reason afflicted, more iust then God, who thus vniustly afflicted him, and vvho moreouer vvould not heare the cries and complaintes of them, that were in tribulation and miserie. And although we must needes confesse that Iob, as a man not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharged with the greatnes of his torments, but also of his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, as it vvere povvring oile into the fire, verie much vexed and disquieted, vttered manie thinges, amiddest his lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whiles hee laboured earnestlie to confute his friendes false and slaunderous accusations: for which hee might worthilie bee
<pb facs="tcp:1955:165"/> reprooued: yet it neuer came in his minde to charge God with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, much lesse to giue foorth in wordes, that hee vvas more iust then God: vvhich double blasphemie most horrible to heare if it had been wroong from him, doubtles Satan and not Iob should haue caried away the victorie in this conflict. Neither surely could this rightlie be gathered out of Iobs wordes, how hardlie soeuer they were spoken, if a man doe not stand vpon the strict forme of wordes, but fauourably weigh the intent and meaning of the speaker: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Iob reasoneth not of those things which happen after death, but onely of the prosperous or vnhappie estate of this life, denying and that rightly, that vve are hereby to iudge of the loue or hatred of God, or of anie mans honest or dishonest life: neither yet did hee stand in defence of his owne righteousnes against God, but onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to God, as a most wise and a iust iudge, against those false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations which were laid against him. Elihu therefore reprooued Iob with greater austeritie then became him; neither trulie doeth he soundlie and substantiallie enough confute those things, which he falsely gathereth out of his speech. For bee it that Iob complayned of God as beeing vniust: whether generallie, for that without anie respect or difference he striketh as well the godlie as the wicked, or particularlie as touching him selfe: for that the integritie of his life past had nothing at all profited him: yet was this answer of Elihu sufficient, to say, that God is not a debter to men bee they neuer so godlie &amp; virtuous, as if he had receiued any benefit at their hands? Now doubtlesse it is not. For this principle still standeth in force, that it is agreeable to the nature of God to take pleasure in good men and to crowne them with his fauourable blessings, and on the contrarie side to hate and punish those that are euill, though he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receyue profit by the one nor damage by the other: from which principle not being rightlie vnderstood all this controuersie between Iob and his accusers tooke its beginning. So then Elihu in the <hi>5. 6.</hi> &amp; <hi>7.</hi> verses, either answereth not to the purpose, or else chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the state of the question, laieth an other thing to Iobs charge, to wit, that he in such sort complained how hardly he was delt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and how there was no regard at all had of him, as if for some benefite he had made God greatlie beholding to him: such as at this daie is that absurd doctrine vvhich the Romish sophisters haue set abroach concerning merite of congruitie, and merite of condignitie. Last of all vvhereas afterward in the <hi>9.10.11.12.13.</hi> verses, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:1955:165"/> answere to that other part of Iobs complaint, namely, that God heareth not alwaies such as are distressed and in miserie when they crie vnto him for helpe and succour, hee auoucheth the whole cause thereof to bee in the prayers of them that crie, as not beeing made with such faith and deuotion as they ought; hee doeth not altogether remooue this difficultie and doubt. For it is manifest by infinite examples both of former ages, and also of these times, that the prayers of holie men, such as iurne vnto God with an vnfeined heart, are not alvvaies hearde, eyther because they know not vvhat they aske; as we may see in the <hi>20.</hi> Chapter of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. verse <hi>22.</hi> and Luke <hi>9.55.</hi> or because God hath otherwise decreed with him selfe, as Ezech, Chap. <hi>14.</hi> vers. <hi>14.</hi> or else because it is not good for them, as <hi>2.</hi> Corinth. Chap. <hi>12.</hi> vers. <hi>9.</hi> Then followeth a double conclusion, the one verie wise and true in the fourteenth verse, the other in the <hi>15.</hi> and <hi>16.</hi> verses ouer harde and rigorous, and contrarie to the purpose and counsell of God in that point, who suffered Iob, not for his punishment (howsoeuer there was not wanting in him, as neither in the best man that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, which he might if it had so pleased him, haue punished with eternall destruction) but for his triall and good, thus to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled of Satan.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 Nowe as touching the other part of thy complaint, out of which again it must necessarily be gathered, that God dealeth iniuriously with iust and vpright men, in that he doth not so much as heare them, when as, being oppressed by those, who are mightier then them selues, they call and crie vnto him, so farre is he from helping and defending them of his owne accorde. I confesse indeede, that the number of them is not small, who, (through the violence of such, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using the power and riches which God hath giuen them, are delighted with nothing more, then with wrong and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) suffer so great and so manifolde iniuries, that they are compelled to crie, yea, and to crie out aloude for helpe and succour. 10 But if any of them be not heard, they are not to blame God but them selues, (and see whether thou mayest not rightly be accounted of this number.) For true it is, that they crie with open mouth, but they doe it being constrained by the burden and greatnesse of their griefe, and not in any reverent regarde of the maiestie of God: neither doe they quietly yeelde and submit them selues to their maker: and yet notwithstanding it is he alone that in extreeme darkenesse and miserie giueth cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysing to them, who religiously call vpon him, and with a godly and faithfull minde flie vnto him for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. 11 Neither hath he created and indued vs onely with that nature, which may teach vs to be touched with a sence and feeling of those thinges which are hurtfull: (for this is common to vs with the beastes of the fielde, and with the foules of the ayre) but he hath moreouer ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our mindes both with vnderstanding, whereby we may knowe God, as also to feare and honour him: and also with reason, to discerne and foresee the causes of thinges, to finde out fitte remedies for all greevances, and wisely to vse them for our owne benefite and commoditie.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 <hi>Then they crie, but he heareth them not</hi> (crying out) <hi>for the pride of the wicked.</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1955:167"/>13 <hi>Surely God will not heare falshoode, neither will the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie looke vnto that</hi> (that is, he will not regarde and favour that.)</p>
                  <p n="12">12 This then is the cause, why they suffering wrongs at the handes of wicked and vngodly men, are not heard, howe loude soeuer they crie: because they neither crie vnto him, whome onely in such straightes they ought to call vpon, nor yet in such manner as they ought, &amp; as it becommeth them. 13 But howsoeuer these men, not crying with a true and sincere affection, are therefore not heard: yet shall God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be found to haue favoured those oppressours, or any way to haue liked and allowed of their oppression, as the ende doeth alwayes prooue.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 <hi>Although thou sayest</hi> (that) <hi>thou seest him not,</hi> (yet) <hi>there is iudgement with him. Therefore trust thou in him.</hi>

                  <p>Yea, sayest thou, but I doe not see him. I grant.

What then should let thee to lay aside these contentious complaints and outcries, and to put thy whole confidence in God, seeing that with him there is right and iudgement for thee against the accusations, which these men haue charged thee withall?</p>
                  <p n="15">15 <hi>But know nowe that his anger hath visited thee but a litle, neither hath he made any great inquisition.</hi>

                  <head>THE SVMME AND ORDER of the xxxvi. Chapter.</head>
                  <p>ELihu continuing on his speech, and againe vsing a graue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, in the first three verses setteth foorth Gods iustice, first of all as touching godly and vpright men, partly in defending them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the iniuries of the wicked, and powring out his blessings vpon them, vers. <hi>5.6.7.</hi> partly also, if happily they haue gone awry, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling them by his fatherly chastisements and corrections, into the right way, except herein they be a let and hinderance to themselues: then secondly, he sheweth Gods iustice in destroying the wicked, which doe not suffer them selues to be made better by his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this he doeth vnto the ende of the <hi>15.</hi> verse. which thinges indeede are verie truelie and wiselie discussed: howbeit Job was not nowe to learne them, neither had he needed to haue bene put in minde thereof, vnlesse the greatnesse of his griefe had caryed him some times, as it were, beyonde him selfe. For he hath no lesse graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled these points, yea, he hath more fullie and substantiallie reasoned of Gods iustice and prouidence, as in diuers other places, so especially in the <hi>27.</hi> Chapter. Neither doubtlesse is there any man, vnlesse he be a plaine Epicure, which wil not confesse the same, which Elihu goeth about here to perswade Iob. Therefore the question was not properly touching this matter, which none would haue denyed, but whether all affliction which happeneth to man, and especiallie being so grievous and so sudden as this was, doeth at all times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from Gods wrath and displeasure conceiued against him, by this meanes either to bring the godly to repentance, when through their infirmitie they are fallen, or vtterly to destroy the wicked. And this doeth Elihu also avouch, and he doubteth not to accompt Iob in the number of the wicked and blasphemours, with whome God is displeased. But herein he differeth from Iobs former accusers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they falsely surmised that God was thus angrie with Job for his life passed, but Elihu thought rather that God was offended with him for his speeches, being open and manifest blasphemies, vers. <hi>16.17.18. and 16.</hi> Neuerthelesse, we haue before shewed that those sayings of Iob were otherwise to be vnderstoode, or at the least to be
<pb facs="tcp:1955:168"/> quallified and taken in the better parte: which thing God truely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and speaking out of the storme, according to his exceeding bountie and moderation, did him selfe afterwardes perfourme. which vnlesse it had come to passe, Job happily by this reproofe of Elihu, woulde haue become farre more vnpatient then he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and at length haue runne headlong into the same downefall, from which neuerthelesse Elihu sought by all meanes to deliuer him. Therefore needes must we confesse, that Satan had none, (no, not Elihu truely being excepted) who did more helpe forwarde his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, in bringing Iob to despaire and open blasphemie, then those, who least of all intended any such matter, but rather the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: such is the craft and subtiltie of this our enemie. Those thinges which followe in Elihu his speech, doe declare howe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully God alwayes provideth for his children: so that this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, from the twentieth verse to the ende of the <hi>37.</hi> Chapter, is as it were, a gentle lenitiue of that sharpe rebuke, which otherwise was likely to driue Job beside all patience. Moreouer it serueth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fitly against those immoderate complaintes of Iob, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to vtter many rash and vnaduised speeches, in so much that Iob coulde not choose but acknowledge, that he had alreadie gone too farre in seeking out the reason, why God shoulde in this sorte deale with him: whereas he ought, as he had begunne, rather to haue rested contented with that, which Gods will and pleasure was to worke vpon him, then thus narrowly to haue searched out the secrets of Gods wisedome, which is alwayes accompanied with his iustice, and which he him selfe had before confessed, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the eyght and twentie Chapter, to be farre aboue the reach and capacitie of man. Nowe this I dare saye, that there is not extant any Poeme either of the Greekes or Latines, which may be compared with this stately eloquence in describing those naturall effectes, which are caused in the aire, and for the same cause are of the Philosophers called meteors, or aërie impressions, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cloudes, raine, haile, snowe, thunder, lightning, and such like, whereof Elihu discourseth verie grauelie and learnedly, as you shall heare in this and in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <p>HItherto wee haue heard Elihu, though somewhat too seuere, yet a necessarie censor, sent before by the prouidence of God, to call Job, who was verie much growne out of patience through the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
<pb facs="tcp:1955:174"/> and slaunderous accusations of his friendes, by his graue and wise reasons, from the defence of his owne vprightnesse to more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this behalfe. Him doth almightie God immediatlie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe appearing of a sudden beyond all their exspectations, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth the same argument, which was begunne by Elihu, but so, that it doeth moste cleerely appeare, what infinite difference there is betweene the speeches of holy men directed by the spirit of God, and the speech of God him selfe, whether you respect the matter or the wordes. And first of all wee are not to imagine of God in this place, as brought in some poeticall tragedie appearing, as it were, out of an engin deuised for that purpose. For the whole naration testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, that this is a true storie of things done indeed, and afterward faithfully recorded &amp; set downe in writing by some holie man being inspired of the holie ghost, whom some of the Iewes affirme to haue beene no other, then Moses himselfe. And to speake trueth this history cannot be referred more fitlie and rightly to anie other time, then to that, wherein the Idumaeans flourished, the Israelites liuing in thraldome vnder the Egyptians. But wee knowe, that Moses liued fortie yeares among the Madianites, where hee might easilie come to the knowledge of these things, as being not done farre from thence, &amp; it may seeme not vnlikely, that as he wrote his first booke called <hi>Genesis</hi> by inspiration from God, so likewise this excellent historie. Nay it is manifest, that in those times, God vsed manie waies extraordinarilie to appeare vnto the fathers, as wee may see in the histories of those times, and long after: neither can it bee doubted, considering the speeches and disputation throughout this wholl booke, but that the true knowledge and worship of God did euen then flourish among the Jdumaeans. And here hee is saide to haue spoken out of the storme (for I had rather interpret it so then a whirlewinde) to testifie thereby his heauenlie maiestie, as in the <hi>1.</hi> of Sam. Chapter <hi>12.</hi> verse <hi>17.</hi> whether it were suddenlie raised, while Ellhu was yet speaking, (for hereunto some referre that which Elihu sayeth in the former Chapter, verse <hi>2. Hearken diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto the sound of his voyce, and to the noyse that goeth out of his mouth)</hi> or else followed straight vvaie so soone as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu had made an ende of his speech, no man thinking of anie such matter. Whereby Iob had that graunted to him, vvhich amidst his former discourses hee had so often and so earnestlie vvished and
<pb facs="tcp:1955:174"/> yet durst never hope, that it woulde so come to passe, namely, that he might freely pleade his owne cause in Gods presence before his tribunall seate. But in this place there are many thinges diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee obserued, for as much as hence wee must gather the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fruite of this storie. And first of all, we may heere beholde howe wonderfull is the providence of Almightie GOD, both in revealing his owne glorie, by so much the more clearely, by howe much the more Satan, and all Satans adherents eyther wittingly or vnwittingly endeavour to obscure it: as also in excercising, but not forsaking, his children according to his will, which howe so euer it is often vnknowen, yet can it neuer bee vniust: and that which is more, in most mightily deliuering them, when their case seemeth to be desperate and past all hope of recouerie. And farther, I pray you, what equitie and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doeth God vse in these his reprehensions. For whereas not one of them but had offended in the former disputation: Iob by standing too much vpon the defence of his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, euen in the sight and presence of GOD: his friendes, in blaming Iobs former life without any iust cause, and in that they deemed amisse of the way and meanes, howe to discerne the hatred or loue of God towardes men, which God him selfe doeth in expresse wordes declare in the two and fortieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verse seventh; whereas, I say, they had all of them offended, howe mildely, howe gentlie, and with what fatherlie affection doeth he rebuke Job: his friendes he taketh vp somewhat more roundlie, but hee receiveth them all againe into his favour? But peradventure you will saye, that he let Elihu goe without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooving him at all, who neverthelesse had misconstrued diuers of Iobs speeches, and tooke them in a farre other sense, then Jobs meaning was, treading also, as it were, in the same steppes, in so much that he may seeme to haue altogether allowed of his accusation. To this I answere, he was foresent of God, who setting before Iobs eyes that great and incomprehensible maiestie of God, might thereby asswage his intemperate moode, which without some sharpe remedie woulde not haue relented. Notwithstanding, this I say, that Elihu his speech was so farre foorth approoved of God, as he had iustly found fault with Iob &amp; his friendes, &amp; had rightly and truely reasoned against them, as touching the maiestie of God, but the manner of his accusation and reproofe was not allowed.
<pb facs="tcp:1955:175"/> For whereas Elihu had accused Job, not onely for being bolde to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into discourse of Gods gouernment, but euen as guiltie of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and impietie, and on the other side had so coldely and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly reprooved his friendes: yea, and had in some sort seemed to agree with them, that Iob was thus punished, for that God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and highly displeased with him: God contrariwise doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende Iob rather with graue then bitter wordes, and as one, who had rather spoken vnadvisedy then wickedly: but he findeth greater fault with his friendes, not onely as iudging fooolishly, but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly of the iudgements of God: and for that, as touching Iob, (whome he absolveth, being by them wrongfully condemned) they had spoken so confidently against the trueth, and falsely charged him with those crimes which he had neuer committed: neither is he reconciled vnto them but by Jobs meanes, making intercession for them. But why is nothing at all saide against Elihu? forsooth, both because he had not offended in the chiefe and maine point of all, as concerning Gods iustice, which he most rightly and religiously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, as also least any newe contention might growe, for making a finall ende whereof, he him selfe had vouchsafed to appeare. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore in this historie, and especially in the conclusion thereof, as in a glasse more cleare then christall, are set out to our viewe, first in God, that singular loue wherewith he embraceth mankinde, and his vnspeakeable mercie towardes them that repent: then in Iob and his friendes, the infirmities euen of the best and wisest men, and that terrible conflict which they haue continually within them, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ioyned with ignorance, wisedome with follie, patience with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie, hope with despaire. courage with cowardlinesse, humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with pride, aptnesse and willingnesse to be taught with ostinacie and rebellion: yet Almightie God doeth at no time forsake these his champions, but in the ende doeth most bountifullie crowne his owne giftes in them. Last of all, God him selfe doeth in these foure Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lay open the knowledge of true naturall philosophie, together with the chiefe and principall ende thereof, to witte, that in these visible creatures we may behold the invisible thinges of God, so that in this onely respect, if there were nothing else, this booke is to be esteemed as an incomparable treasure, and daily to be read and meditated of vs. Now as touching these two beastes, the land <hi>Behemoth,</hi> &amp; the water <hi>Leviathan,</hi> both which God largely describeth in the <hi>40.</hi> &amp; <hi>41.</hi> Chapters, those things which are spoken of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> do so fitly
<pb facs="tcp:1955:175"/> and properly agree to the Elephant, that in my iudgement none nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to doubt, but that he meaneth this beast and none other: and the Hebrues doe not vnfitly teach, that it is tearmed by the plurall number, as if you would say <hi>(beastes)</hi> because, being indeed but one, it may for the huge bignesse thereof stande for many. Neither doe J doubt, but that in the <hi>40.</hi> chapter, verse <hi>12.</hi> by the worde <hi>Zanav,</hi> which is commonly taken for a tayle, so called, bccause it is a parte sticking out at the backe, is signified not the taile of the elephant, but his large snowte, which beareth the resemblance of another taile, which truely as being proper to the elephant, and as hauing in this beast a most marveilous and necessarie vse, might not in any wise be pretermitted in this description. Nowe that by the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> is not meant that fish which we call a whirlepoole, nor yet any other whale fish, but the Crocodile, that huge and terrible monster of Nilus, (that I may let passe the other partes of his description, and especially his backe beset as it were with little hillockes, being so hard that nothing is able to pearce them, and also the hard plates of his bellie) it is hereby manifest, that among the whalefishes there is not one that beareth scales, nor yet any that hath necke, and onely two, namely, the whirlepoole and that which is called <hi>Orca,</hi> are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with teeth. Neither doeth that any whit derogate from the trueth of this my opinion, that in the <hi>2.</hi> verse of the <hi>40.</hi> Chapter, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of a tongue, which the Crocodiles want. For it is not sayde, that the <hi>Leviathan</hi> hath a tongue, but it is there denyed, that he can be taken as the fishes, which with the hooke are caught and pulled vp by the tongue or iawes. And doubtlesse to the Idumaeans and people of the countries adioyning, being very farre distant from the deepe sea, but neere vnto Aegipt, the kingdome whereof at that time flourished, the Elephants and Crocodiles were as well knowen, as these vaste monsters of the Ocean were vnknowen vnto them. which peradventure could hardly haue swomme in the Arabian goulfe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 &amp; 2 Then Iob, beeing ouercome with the great maiesty of God, rather thundring forth out of the storme, then spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the manner of men, and not beeing able to holde his peace any longer: I acknowledge, saith he, that there is nothing which thou art not able to doe, and as thy counsels are wise and iust, so also, that thou wantest not power, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish and bring to passe, whatsoeuer thou hast decreed. 3 Trulie thou hadst good cause, O Lord, to rebuke my fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shnes, by asking the question, what manner of man he might be, who by so much the more obserued thy counsels, by how much the more deepelie he searched into them. Therefore, I confesse, that I haue vttered such things, as I did not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, beeing altogether vnknowne, farre aboue the reach of my slender capacitie. 4 Shall I say, that this hath happened to me through mine owne fault, and deseruing, that thou shouldest vse these wordes to me, <hi>Heare J pray thee, and I will speake?</hi> For surelie it belongeth vnto thee to commaund, and not to intreat that thou maist be heard. It is thy part, I say, to commaund what thou wilt haue done, and mine to giue eare to that which thou commaundest. And againe, I was very much ashamed of my selfe, when as thou saidst, <hi>I will aske of thee, and doe thou teach mee,</hi> For I, O Lord, am to aske and to learne, and not thou. 5 On the other side, how great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is this which thou doest now bestow vpon me, in that thou hast vouchsafed me, thy presence and speech in this storme, wheras before, I onely knew thee by hearesay: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, by those things which I haue heard our Fathers tell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy power, thy wisdome, and thine excellent works. 6 Therefore I doe not onelie recant and call backe, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:1955:187"/> I haue before time, either thought or spoken vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but I do euen abhorre my selfe in that respect. Loe, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge mine offence before thee, &amp; I am hartely sory for the same, This dust &amp; ashes shal be a witnes of my repētance.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>And it came to passe after the Lord had spoken these wordes vnto Iob, the Lord said vnto Eliphaz the Themanite. My wrath is kindled against thee, &amp; thy companions, because yee haue not spoken of me the thing that is right, like my seruant Iob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Therefore take vnto you now seuen bullocks and seuen rams, and go to my seruant Iob, &amp; offer vp for your selues a burnt offering. And my seruant Iob shall pray for you. For his face will J accept, least J worke, foolishnes with you,</hi> (that is, least I so behaue my selfe towards you, as your foolishnes doth deserue) <hi>because you haue not spoken of me the thing, which is right, like my seruant Iob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>So Eliphaz the Themanite, aed Bildad the Suhite, and Tso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord had said vnto them, and he accepted the face of Iob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 These speeches hauing thus passed between the Lord and Iob, the Lord being much more displeased with those his three friends, forasmuch as they neither had spoken and iudged aright concerning his prouidence, by which hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth all things, neither yet concerning the certen tokens of his loue and hatred, and moreouer also had falsly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Iobs former life, as guiltie of great wickednesse and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, thereby almoste driuing him into desperation: turning his speech vnto Eliphaz the Themanite, verely I (saith hee) am highly offended with thee and with thy two companions, because yee haue not spoken so rightlie of mee as it became you, and as my seruant Iob hath done, whome you haue assailed without all right and reason. 8. Goe yee therfore, and taking seuen young heifers and so many rammes, deliuer them to my seruant Iob, that hee may offer them vp to mee for you in a burnt sacrifice. For hee shall pray for you, so farre shall hee bee from recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing euill for euil. And as for me I will be reconciled to you for his sake and at his intreaty, that you may not receiue the reward of your foolishnes which ye haue deserued, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not spoken rightlie of me, as my seruant Iob hath done. 9 So those three, namely Eliphaz the Themanite, Bildad the
<pb facs="tcp:1955:187"/> Shuite, and Tsophar the Naamathite, were obedient to the commaundement of the Lord, giuing forth a most singular example of a modest &amp; humble minde, which is alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and willing to be reformed. Neither surelie had they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of wickednes or mallice, but of ignorance &amp; vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And Iob on the other side (as it becommeth vertuous &amp; godlie men to doe) straightway forgetting al iniuries, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that duetie, which God had inioyned him: &amp; his praiers for his three friends were acceptable to God.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 <hi>And the Lord turned the captiuitie of Job into the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when he prayed for his friendes: and he gaue Iob twise so much as he had before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, this intreatie, which Iob made for those his friends, who had dealt so hardly &amp; iniuriously with him, God tooke in so good parte, as that forthwith he turned all his miseries and afflictions, wherewith Satan had fast tied him as a captiue with chaines and fetters, he turned them I say, into a state and condition cleane contrarie to that, wherein he had beene thus grieuouslie tried; and for those things which Iob had before time in his possessiō, he now bestowed vpon him double so much as he had taken from him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 <hi>For there came vnto him all his brethren, &amp; all his sisters, &amp; as manie as had bene of his acquaintance before, and did eate bread with him in his house: and had compassion of him and comforted him for all the euill, that the Lord had brought vpon him, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man gaue some one of his cattell, &amp; euerie one an earing of gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12 <hi>Moreouer the Lord blessed the last</hi> (state) <hi>of Iob more then his former. For he had</hi> 14 <hi>thousand sheep, &amp;</hi> 6 <hi>thousand camells, &amp; a thousand yoke of Oxen, and a thousand shee Asses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 For God changing their mindes, all the men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were of his kindred, &amp; al that before time had bene familiarly acquainted with him, came vnto him of their own accord, &amp; did eat meat with him in his own house, protesting that they tooke that his misfortune very heavily, and they comforted him in the best manner that they could; yea, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them gaue him either a sheepe, or an oxe, or a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, and also an eare ring of gold: partly as a pledge of their goodwill and friendship renewed towards him, and partly in considration &amp; recompence of that losse, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:1955:188"/> by the will and foreappointment of God, sustained. 12 Moreouer, God marveilously blessed him with increase, and made this his latter condition much better then his former, in somuch, that he did nowe possesse fourteene thousande sheepe, sixe thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand shee asses.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 <hi>He had also seuen sonnes and three daughters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14 <hi>And he called the name of one,</hi> Iehimimah: <hi>&amp; the name of the second,</hi> Kesiah: <hi>and the name of the third,</hi> Keren-happuch.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 <hi>And in all the lād were no womē found so faire as the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iob, &amp; their father gaue thē inheritance among their brethrē.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13 Likewise he gaue him so many children as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wit, 7. sonnes, and 3. daughters of rare excellencie, as their names may witnes. 14. 15 For he called the first <hi>Iehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimab,</hi> as it were, the brightnes of the day: the second <hi>Casia,</hi> that is, the most pretious spice, or cinamon: the third, <hi>Keren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happuch,</hi> which is as much to say as the horne or strength of the white Alabaster: neither were there any womē through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all that coūtry, in beauty &amp; comlines to be cōpared with Iobs daughters: whom their father loued so dearly, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his sonnes, (which was a thing very rare, and not often before heard of in those places) he made them heires of his substance and possessions.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 <hi>And after this, Iob liued an hundreth and fourtie yeeres, and saw his sonnes, and his sonnes sonnes, euen to foure generations:</hi>

                  <p n="16">16 Finally, that God might heape all manner of blessings vpon this his victorious champion, he liued after this cōflict &amp; triall a hundreth &amp; fourty yeres, &amp; that in continual helth &amp; prosperity, in somuch that he saw his childrens childrē vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fourth generation: 17 And at the length being very olde &amp; full of yeres, ended his life.</p>
